        "content": "FSA/USDA CED/PT Career Questions\nHi all,\n\nLong story short(er), I am looking at switching careers and getting back into agriculture, I worked for an aerial application service before my current job (FedEx). I have some ag knowledge from growing up in a farming community, and my father has been a Program Technician for as long as I can remember. While working I have managed to get my Associates and am 2 semesters from my Bachelors. I have been trying to get into the USDA office forever and an opening finally arose the town over from mine as a full-time PT. Applied, got referred, potentially interviewing next week. I think this is a great opportunity to get my foot in the door as far as learning the programs and what goes on in the agency. My dad and I aren't super close.. but he has told me a little about it and he absolutely loves his job and the work he has done. \n\nHe and the CED at his office have both talked to me about becoming a CED as a career at my young age.. but I haven't gotten much info about timeframe, program details, what the process is like, salary, etc. Was wondering if anyone here has any experience or could shed some light on any of that for me. Any help is appreciated!",

                "content": "Becoming a CED is a great career choice. Most CED positions currently max out at a CO-12 pay grade (currently ranging from $76,721 - $99,741 depending on the time in service). That figure also incorporates a base locality pay. In addition to salary, also a great set of benefits are available. Also lots of time off and generally no nights or weekends. If you want to be a CED, you first have to go through a 9-12 month training program. It may be a good idea to be a PT for a few years before applying for a CED position, this may increase your competitiveness for the position if your having trouble getting a CED offer. Some downsides to working with the FSA? Well, don't expect to be out in the field much at all. Your work will be very much administration - expect your days to be filled with government paperwork. The CED position is better than the PT position in terms of variability of job tasks - PTs can often have very repetitive and sedentary jobs. If you really want to be in the field more, then the NRCS may be the better government ag-related agency to work for. However, if you can stand lots of policy, procedure, and bureaucracy, than the FSA might be for you!",

        "content": "A look at imaging use in agriculture [a bit of market research]\nHi, I'm not usually found over here in these parts, but the events of this year have really caused me to examine my work and my future.  As I have family who own a farm a couple hours away, I started looking into things I could do, being an aviation guy, in the agricultural industry.  Imaging (and to a lesser extent, spraying) came to my attention, and I decided to do a bit of research.  \n\nTo that end, I've created [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19CuG-j8OgiS9RXE3iyCYbP3vY4dTdEQbTLdsN27Qmxs) to get an idea how prevalent (or not) digital imagery use actually is.  I ask a lot of questions in it, and I understand that some people may have no interest in answering some of them (I've included \"other\" options and a number of statement and paragraph blocks without validation so that they can be skipped with a random entry or even a single letter if they're considered \"required\" questions) but as I'm a rather uneducated entrant at this point I'm working with what I could learn in the last couple weeks.  \n\nI would appreciate anyone who has a farm and wants to take the time to do this, and I promise that there are no questions asking for your email or phone number.  No marketing at all.  Really.  This is all just research--i may even abandon my idea and stick with my regular job.",

A Phantom 4 Pro and software licenses will run you multiple thousands of dollars, and you'll only be collecting RGB images. To get accurate NDVI or multispectral data that price point is going to jump significantly.\n\nYou might want to have some conversations with local farmers to get a sense of who would pay for imaging services. If you can prove that you know what you're doing (this is important), then you'll be able to get more people onboard.\n\nIf you haven't already, do some research into the costs and learning required on your part to collect and process aerial images. I spent the last few years building out a drone imaging program for the agricultral tech startup I worked at. Depending on the kind and quality of data you're collecting and what you want to use it for, the process can be a pain in the ass. Weed mapping, for example, will need very high resolution RGB images at the proper timing if you want to be able to distinguish weeds from row crops. I know for me the technical hangups were a thorn in my side for years. Happy to discuss drone stuff any time.\n\nGood luck!",

        "content": "The Sun Never Sets on Bad Agricultural Policies: How Colonial Administrators, Socialist Bureaucrats, and Multinational Corporations Failed at Farming in Tanzania\nDrive through rural Indiana or Iowa, one will pass row after row of soy and corn. The farmers of the American midwest practice some of the most technologically sophisticated agriculture in the world. American agriculture is fully mechanized, makes heavy use agriculture inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and reliant upon mono-cropping highly lucrative crops such as corn and soy. This is in stark contrast to Tanzania, where many farmers use the same implements they would have a thousand years ago, and where yields are a fraction of what they are in the United States. It is easy to assume that these poor peasants are a dead weight on agricultural development, and the transforming the Tanzanian economy will require replacing peasant farming with modern agriculture. Development policy under colonial rule, socialist rule, and the current capitalist government have all been based on these assumptions. Today\u2019s podcast will be looking at the disastrous consequences of these assumptions.\n\nThe United Kingdom, the colonial power that ruled Tanzania, was suffering from major shortages and inflation in the aftermath of WWII. The government of the time, decided investing massively in large scale peanut farming in Tanzania would both help alleviate cooking oil shortages in the UK and bring agricultural development to Tanzania. Between 1948 and 1951 the United Kingdom through the the state controlled Overseas Food Corporation invested $2.9 billion in modern currency. From the beginning, the plan was a fiasco. The Port of Dar es Salaam did not have the equipment to handle the massive influx of agricultural equipment and the only railroad connecting the selected site to Dar es Salaam was washed out in floods. The OFC failed to plan for the massive influx of workers clearing and preparing the land for farming, forcing many into unsanitary tent cities. Most importantly, the farming itself proved to be far more difficult than expected. The American tractors broke down in transportation. The high clay and quartz content of the soil baked into something near concrete, wearing the plough shares down. Most famously, the OFC attempted retrofit WWII tanks into agricultural bulldozers. In the end, total peanut production was minimal. The groundnut scheme was only one of many failed British agricultural programs in Tanzania. Many tried to micromanage the lives of farmers, telling them how to farm their land and raise their livestock, while having little idea of the realities of farming in Tanzania.\n\nTanzania gained its independence from Great Britain in 1961, and its new socialist leadership under Julius Nyerere promised a completely new direction, guided by the ideology of Ujamaa (which translates to family-ness in Swahili) a form of African socialism. However, the new administration inherited many of the biases of the previous colonial government. The socialist government intervened far more forcefully into the lives of ordinary farmers, the most intense example of which was uprooting up to 13 million farmers from their traditional farmsteads and concentrating them in large villages. The official justification was that it was easier to provide health and education services, yet from an agricultural perspective they were a failure. An example of this failure was that of Mbarali Farms, a large rice farm created as an aid project by the Chinese government between 1971 and 1977, investing approximately $82 million in current dollars, to construct a highly mechanized rice farm. However, after transfer to Tanzanian authorities, the rice farms suffered from the same problems as the groundnut scheme. The Mbarali Farms mechanized methods struggled to manage water levels and weeding, and yields at Mbarali Farms decreased by 60% between 1980 and 1989. Nearby African peasants, using traditional benefits and not benefiting from foreign aid, had rice yields about 15% higher than those at Mbarali Farms.\n\nHowever, the same attitudes towards farmers have changed slowly under the pro-market governments that took over after Nyerere stepped down from power. An example of this can be seen in the government of Tanzania\u2019s encouragement of large scale global agro-business to grab land, to farm with modern methods. One example of these failures are Sun Biofuels acquisition of 20,000 acres of uncultivated forest in the region of Kisarawe. The local farmers made use of this land for water, lumber and other forest products. Sun Biofuels promised 4,000 jobs for locals, and promised to invest in roads, hospitals and rural infrastructure and so the farmers allowed to farm this land for only a nominal fee. The jatropha plantations suffered the same fate as the Groundnut Scheme and Mbarali farms, and the jatropha crops failed under Tanzanian conditions. A collapse of global commodity prices, and the jatropha plants lack of resilience to drought and local pests doomed the project. Moreover, only 44 jobs were created for locals, as the project relied heavily upon mechanized methods. The land did not revert to the farmers after the collapse of the jatropha crops, and was acquired by Mtanga Foods, a Tanzanian agrobusiness company to raise cattle.\n\nForeign investment, modern technology, and mechanization all play an important role in modernizing Tanzanian agriculture. However, these methods need to be adapted to Tanzanian conditions, and especially the needs of Tanzanian farmers if they are to succeed. Farmers need access to fertilizer, irrigation, and high yielding seeds to succeed. Moreover, they need access to quality extension services that respects the farmers understanding of the land he farms, and adapts the latest technology to the situation on the ground. In recent decades, government policy in Tanzania has been moving in this direction, and the results have been impressive. Between 2006 and 2016, maize production has increased 71%, rice production 247%, and sweet potato production 275%. The results match those in green revolution countries such as India and Indonesia. Tanzanian farmers, if given the right tools and incentives, can match farmers anywhere in the world for productivity.  \n\n\n \n\n[http://wealthofnationspodcast.com/](http://wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/211-2/](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/211-2/)\n\n[https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/tanzania\\_-\\_agriculture.mp3](https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/tanzania_-_agriculture.mp3)",

        "content": "Considering switching my major to Agriculture. Pro/Cons?\nI'm 33 and currently going back to school. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Biology at WSU Tri-Cities. I'm only in my first year going back to school. (My first degree was in Fine Art.) Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of people. I love animals, being outdoors, and watching the sunrise on a crisp morning. I've never worked on a farm, though I did volunteer rehabilitating abused and neglected horses in high school. \n\nMy great grandparents had a farm that had been in their family since Oklahoma was first a territory, but they raised the sort of horses that the every man used, (mainly cart, buggy, and plow horses). When the day came that the common man had cars instead of horses and horses were seen as a luxury of the rich, their farm was no longer able to make a living. Much of it was sold and the family all had to find jobs in other sectors.\n\nI've always loved going out there. It's super peaceful, and pretty amazing feeling connected to a piece of land that's been your family for family for nearly 130-140 years. I'd love it if the family I have someday could grow up somewhere that they feel that connected to.\n\nI know gardening is nothing like farming, but always had gardens growing up and loved growing all sorts of fruits, veggies and flowers. I do also know how to keep bees and grow mushrooms. (I got super into the history of the frontier as a kid after my grandpa gave me the foxfire series. I used to do things like weaving and dyeing cloth.)\n\nEven though I know I couldn't make a living raising horses, I love that owning and living on a farm or a ranch would give me the opportunity to \"live in the saddle\" as James Taylor sung. \n\nI don't know how viable it is, but in addition to whatever else we grow, I'd love to have a small apple orchard for pick your own apples, a pumpkin patch for pick your own pumpkins, corn for a corn maze and some christmas trees for cut your own christmas tree. (I'm a total sucker for halloween.)\n\nI'm pretty open to what I'd grow. I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.\n\nI kinda like the idea of growing stuff then processing it onsite to make it into some sort of food item that could be sold online.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this all sounds silly to y'all but I'd really love to get your advice. What are the pros and cons of going into agriculture? Would you suggest switching my major or possibly double majoring? Could continuing in computer science in addition, help me as a farmer/rancher?",

                "content": "First, you have a very romantic version of a farming in your head. What you see is not a farm career or something that exists as a farm business actually. You see painting of a farm, a caricature of a farm.\n\nFirst, you do not need a degree to farm. Just like you do not need a degree to write poetry or paint. It may help in certain situations, but the reality is that many painters are self taught and no amount of college will help you be a poet if you lack talent. \n\nSecond, do you want a career in agriculture or are you just dreaming of a farm? There is a difference. If you want to have your own farm get a degree in one of three things, Crop Science if you want to grow crops, Animal Science if you want to raise livestock, or just plain of Agribusiness if you want to farm period.  \n\nIf you think you can walk out with a degree and start and run a farm with no experience and just a vision, well.....Unless your family is leaving you lots of money or land that is going to be hard. \n\nPersonally, I woudl recommend you get the computer science degree and get a day job while you find a small farm and get started. I work with IT and software vendors a lot. If anything they have a lot more jobs that allow working from home. A day job while you get the farm established and then free lance work at home type stuff until you really are making money.   \n\n>I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.  \n\nThat can be true, but like a lot of things is based on a huge number of assumptions. Statistically, the USDA census of farmers says over 2/3 have to work off farm to eat. It also shows that the failure rate of new farms is super high. It also shows that more than half of farms are losing money year to year. As far as what is economical the local extension office talks about a guy who came in. He wanted to see the per acre data on what was the most profitable in IL. Turns out it is actually parsley at the time. He then shows up late the next summer and wants to know how to harvest and sell the parsley. He grew like 50 or 60 acres of it. He did understand the actual processing, marketing, and sales of parsley. \n\nI would continue your degree path in CS and while you do that take electives in AG and Hort. I would also get involved in the extension office for the university you are at and take whatever seminars, classes,etc they have for new farmers. Go actually work on a farm that is farming how you think you want to farm on a weekends. Talk to the farmers at the farmers markets. \n\nGetting a degree in Ag is not necessarily the best path to a farm. ",

If you like to tinker and to experiment, the above won't be your biggest stumbling block.\n\nInstead, and as someone in a similar position to you, I would say consider learning the business aspect of things (marketing, selling), administrative stuff, regulations etc.\n\nI would also consider starting small scale with small amounts of paid up capital.

        "content": "Can I ask for advice?\nHello, I recently saw an opportunity in agriculture. I studied agriculture business and international trade in school. Didn't really had a passion for it until recently. I started working for my family company and we are primarily in the sugar cane business. We hire farmers and rent land, also have set up factories to produce sugar, molasses, basically everything sugar cane. We also started to move into cassava business. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever recently I was offered an opportunity to start out on my own with upwards of 2000 hectares for agricultural purposes. I am not too familiar with the actual farming technology and I hardly know where to begin. I don't even know what crops to use. Basically I have to make a proposal and present said proposal to investors. There will be competition too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it's an extremely complex job and requires years of skills and dedication and I don't really expect to be successful, but this past year has really ignited my passion of agriculture and I would like to start on my own. If I can atleast secure 50 hectares of land for agriculture, that would be a really really good start for me. One of the main advantage for me though, is that I'm familiar with industrial 4.0 since I set up the factories production chain as experience and the primary requirement from investors is to apply high agriculture technology. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo bluntly summarize, where should I start? choosing crops? surveying land? machinery? I am really really lost and thanks in advance for any input.  ",

                "content": "It depends. I am working full time and just finished a 2 year AAS in Agri-Hort Business. I learned a lot to apply to my farm and it gave a piece of paper for when we go to the bank in a year or two for a bank loan to get bigger. \n\nHowever, I have a pretty good day job. The house we bought is actually a farm with 25 acres. We are growing vegetables and starting to sell this year at farmers markets and to restaurants. We are also adding raised beds with perennial herbs. We have chickens and sell nest eggs off the farm. The wife has taken a leave of absence from her job(retail) and probably won't go back. I hope to only have to work for a couple more years till I can take my cash balance retirement and walk. Then we plan to run the farm full time. For us the key is trying to NOT have to get the bank loan or to minimize it. We have a reasonable business plan, good credit, and a market. But I still don't like the risk. So we will get ourselves well positioned before we make the loan leap. That would be to buy more acreage and put in a bunch of greenhouses and Hops trellises. \n\nAt like a decade and half older than you I am worried it is a little late to start a new career path, but fuck it. \n\nHere is the bottom line: Decide what is maximum level of security you are willing to give up NOW for the family now to have something maybe better LATER. I would say some combination of things might be in order:\n\nFirst: if you are working don't quit the day job. Look into local community/junior college ag programs. See if they have \"certificates\" for stuff that they offer while working toward a degree. Get a certificate a few classes at a time. \n\nSecond get with the state extension service office. See what free classes and programs they have. Learn as much as you can. Get out and meet people in ag. This will help you with knowledge and to maybe meet someone who can help you with the next phase. \n\nThird: Get a part time job. Find a landscaper. Offer to help on nights and weekends or when you have time. maybe just a day or two a week or pick up slack during busy times. OR find a farmer that needs help at planting time or harvest time. maybe the local dairy goat farm needs someone to help pull new fence or spring clean out a deep littered barn. You get experience and start to get ideas about what you really want to do. \n\nForth: make the leap. Two years in you have a basic horticulture or agriculture production certificate form the college, you knwo a bunch of guys, and one of them needs someone to work or lead a work crew. You jump from the day job to landscaping or staff at the green house. \n\nNow you are working in the industry. Keep working and learning. Keep taking the college classes. Now you can finnish out the business classes and math. Get that degree. \n\nLast phase is now you have several years experience in the business working for someone, you have a AAS, start your own place or buy into one. I see several businesses and farms that sell or get bought out every year. Growers want to retire. Someone get s sick and can't herd dairy goats anymore, or whatever. Maybe instead of a full cold start you buy into a turnkey operation. \n\n\nIt is doable. Just take it in little bites. ",

                "content": "31 + 2 years for an associates degree seems risky when the end goal is to own your own landscaping or other related agriculture business, and you already have some student debt.\n\nHow old are your kids, in 3-5 years would 1 or more be able to help you run a lawn mower or a leaf blower, etc?\n\nI think your time would be better spent working for a landscape crew or on the grounds crew for a golf course. Do that for 2-3 years and make money, rather than more debt for the associates, and learn on the job. So about the same amount of time, gaining knowledge, hit up the local library for as many horticultural books as you can and be paid for your time.\n\nIf you have cash to pay for the associates degree that\u2019s great! Leave that money in a money market account, (low return but zero risk for 2-3 years), and use that to purchase equipment when the time comes.\n\nI am 35, and am about to start farming myself. If I were in your shoes, I would start with the golf courses and ask to speak with the head grounds keeper, tell them your Elevator Pitch of a 2-3 year goal to start your own XYZ business and that you are a sponge eager to learn all that you can, and ask for a job that would allow you to learn AND in 6-12 months be responsible for managing a small crew or fully responsible for some aspect of the work. Yes, ask for management opportunities, and you may add that you would do it without increased pay. \n\nSo much of owning your own business is managing all the small details. \n\nI have worked fir one golf course and knowing the guys there, I think the head grounds guy would have gone for this. A lot of the employees were college or high school students. Having a 25-35 year old come in, wanting to learn, and could help heard the cats would probably have been a great deal for him.\n\nBasically your asking for an apprenticeship. Willing to work for less pay, with the expectation that you will be actively educated, and ultimately get more responsibility than a \u201cnormal\u201d employe would, in a shorter amount of time, because both you and the \u201cboss\u201d, know it\u2019s for a specific amount of time.\n\nGolf courses also have the advantage of working with golfers who will appreciate your work, and could become your landscape/yard maintenance clients.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t any golf courses in your area, I would research every landscape company and garden/nursery/greenhouse in your region. Like deep research, try and know all the competition and each companies history, services provided, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and their internal narrative as you can before you go and talk with anyone.  \n\nThis serves multiple purposes. First and foremost all of these companies will either be your competition, your vendors, or depending on what route you take they could be your customers. \n\nThis also gives you the opportunity to learn who among this group may have the heart of a teacher and be willing to take on an apprentice who may go on to start a company that would compete with them. However when you sit down to talk with them about your apprenticeship idea and your goal of owning your own company in 2-3 years you can communicate how you know who all the regional players are and that your intention is not to compete against who ever trains you, but to further help them stomp out all the other completion. \n\nIt\u2019s been my experience in agricultural and manufacturing circles that the honorable companies and individuals are always willing to help people and competitors out in nearly anyway they can. They know business is difficult and that they were helped along the way. They also know that they don\u2019t want to be successful at what they do by poisoning the well for others. They want to be the best because they are the best. \n\nIn both of the examples above, golf course or commercial apprenticeship, you will be showing the leadership necessary to own your own business in the future. People may tell you no, and wish you luck, but you will have made a positive impression, and will have begun the process of professionally networking within the sector you want to work in. Maybe your plans change and you don\u2019t own your own business but 2-3 years from now your not finishing your degree and looking to start, but are instead taking over more responsibility with your current employer when the apprenticeship ends. Or you are afforded the opportunity to purchase your mentors landscape company, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI think these options give you more opportunities than the associates degree would in the long term.\n\nBlessings and good luck. \n\n\n\n\n",

I was wondering if any of you had any insight about field engineering work in agriculture. Searching indeed.com, it seems like a Precision Agriculture Agronomist is the closest match for my interest level, in that it seems like they visit different farms, collect and analyze data, and generate reports to help farmers make more informed decisions. However, it does not seem like I am qualified for this position, because the requirements list an Agricultural degree, or some kind of Agricultural technical experience. I am considering volunteering or interning on a farm to gain the relevant experience that would help me get the job I am searching for.\n\nSo, TLDR: Does anyone here know of an agricultural position that could benefit from the skills of an electrical engineer in a field setting, and what skills would be best to develop to round out my experience level?",

I've been working as a frontend web developer in the finance world for a couple years now. It's been fun, I've learned a ton, but there are a lot of important problems to solve out there, and the problems of the finance world are ranking lower and lower on my list as other more pressing things, climate change especially, start to get more urgent and dire.\n\nSoftware engineering is an occupation that has so much power to influence and shape the world in exciting and important ways, so I'm trying to do some research on areas where I could use my SE skills to start pushing the world towards a more sustainable future.\n\nSustainable agriculture is one thing that excites me in particular. I've always really liked the story of the Haber process, which is how we extract nitrogen from the atmosphere to use as fertilizer, which in turn is one of the main reasons why we can feed 9 billion people on this planet today. It's such a cool case study for how science can improve the world, and software is another tool which can impact food production in a positive way. \n\nI'm hoping that you all have some advice on getting into the industry from the software side of things, or maybe have some interesting directions for me to look in as I figure out the lay of the land. Companies, job titles, tech stacks, even anything tangentially related to the industry would be golden as I try to figure out which way is up! Self driving tractors, weather satellites, AI, I am all ears. \n\nFor some context: I'm currently living in NYC, although I'm looking to relocate within the US, especially the west.\n\nThank you!",

I used to work for an aerial imagery agtech company and those types of plays are a dime a dozen. Are you looking for an idea to work on or a company to work for?",

Every type - frontend, backend, data science, etc, are in demand.\n\nI\u2019m a software engineer (~8 years) and have been working in the AgTech industry for the past 3. I love it and I honestly can\u2019t think of any other industry I\u2019d rather work in. I did finance for a few years before this, so I understand what you mean by the types of problems they are solving. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that the agriculture industry is insanely huge and complex, and very fascinating to those interested. I\u2019ve also learned that Growers around the world have it HARD. Farming is just a super hard thing to do, but recent advancements in machinery have made easier and better in many ways.  There\u2019s an enormous amount of data collected about the millions of acres used for farming - satellite imagery, data collected from planters, combines, harvesters, sprayers etc, farm logistics and management systems. The list goes on. Turning that data into software to help farmers is a pretty fun problem to solve.\n\nI\u2019ve worked for two of the bigger corporations, really just by chance. There\u2019s a bunch of startups and large companies hiring the last time I checked. Honestly I told the recruiter I was working with that I really only wanted a software engineering job in the Agriculture industry, and he found me one (Chicago).  Good luck with your search!!",

        "content": "The Possibility of Making Organic Foods Globally Accessible through Blockchain Technology\nThe food industry is undeniably one of the largest industries in the world. With the massive growth the industry sees every year, as at 2017 the global food and agriculture industry was valued at about 8.1 trillion in dollars, yet getting quality food is still largely a problem to be solved. The bulk of the problem is not in the shortage of food supply but in the quality of good food available for consumption.\n\nModern or new ways of farming which range from genetically engineered animals to using chemicals such as pesticides and other methods of improving crop and livestock yields has not helped. The problems are replete which include but not limited to health problems, hazardous to biodiversity in this time of endangered species, and of course reduces the potential yield of the soil itself.\n\nOrganic farming has shown that many of these health problems and imbalance on the ecosystem can be comfortably taken care of quite naturally if we resort to this style and method of agriculture. Sadly, percentage of organic foods in the global food industry is so small, valued at $90 billion from 1999 to 2016 which is just 1.1% of the value of the global food industry. This stunted growth in organic food supply emanates from myriads of challenges that militate against the boom of the organic food production system. Big organizations out there who are bent on raking in the billions but care less about the adverse effects of genetically engineered foods and their accompanied methods of production do almost anything to maintain the status quo.\n\nWell of course, as many as the problems plaguing our world is, so are the possible solutions to reducing and eradicating these problems. This is actually what the Green World Farm project seeks to achieve. With their revolutionary idea of making organic food very much popular and accessible globally through its adoption of the blockchain technology to bring about value chain expansion.\n\nHow has GWF proposed to solve this problem using blockchain? Reading through their whitepaper they have a clear cut strategy of leveraging on the smart contract under the Ethereum blockchain. The need for a trustless system is well taken care of with the smart contract system. Breach of trust and contracts which affects farmers can be well taken care of using the smart contract model as farmers can start producing after entering into an agreement with buyers of their produce knowing fully well that their payment is guaranteed as it\u2019s been managed under the Ethereum smart contracts system. Blockchain offers a means for farmers to contract with sellers to grow what is needed. Full or partial payment can go into escrow immediately to guarantee payment to the farmer without breach of contract and coercion by marketers. Getting paid for labour is a big challenge in the farming world, and Blockchain can alleviate part of that through smart contracts.\n\nHaving checked through the amazing idea and the fact that they have ready farms and the farmers from an agricultural rich nation like Nigeria with a known reputation of high quality yield of agricultural produce due to its very fertile soil and good climatic condition which favours farming, and of course the fact that the US farms will become operational in the near future causing even greater expansion for the farmers as the project progresses along its roadmap, I think the GWF project is one project to keep a close eye on and perhaps invest in their ICO which starts on May 14, 2018 12pm UTC and ends on July 14, 2018 11pm UTC\n\nFor more information please check https://greenworldfarm.io ",

I was wondering if any of you had any insight about field engineering work in agriculture. Searching indeed.com, it seems like a Precision Agriculture Agronomist is the closest match for my interest level, in that it seems like they visit different farms, collect and analyze data, and generate reports to help farmers make more informed decisions. However, it does not seem like I am qualified for this position, because the requirements list an Agricultural degree, or some kind of Agricultural technical experience. I am considering volunteering or interning on a farm to gain the relevant experience that would help me get the job I am searching for.\n\nSo, TLDR: Does anyone here know of an agricultural position that could benefit from the skills of an electrical engineer in a field setting, and what skills would be best to develop to round out my experience level?",

I won't say it's guaranteed that you'll find what you want, but ag is a blossoming sector with a lot of opportunity. \n\nMy best advice is that if you are passionate about ag, do whatever you can now before jumping in head first.  If it's engineering, try tinkering with some tractors or hobbiest hydroponic systems.  If it's actual farming, try getting a community plot, or volunteering at a small farm operation to see what it's really like.  Best of luck!",

        "content": "An area of topsoil equivalent to 2,700 football pitches would be lost in just 90 mins!\nThough many farmers in this forum, and I am sure you are well aware of some of the issues raised here. You may agree that we have to match profitability (in some cases survival fund) to that of environmental benefits. Nevertheless, we (as collectively) have to do something about the topic discussed in this article.\n\nAt a 2014 forum held in Rome and organised by the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Maria \u2013 Helena Semedo gave a stark warning to all those attending that it takes 1,000 years to generate 3  centimetres of top soil and approximately one-third has been lost. If the present rate of soil degradation continued, all the World\u2019s topsoil would be gone within 60 years. She went to say that degraded soil means the amount of arable and productive land per person in 2050 will be only 25&#37; of what it was in 1960.\n\n>This was put in more simplistic term by Volkert Engelsman of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, who said that the World is losing an area of soil equivalent to 30 soccer fields a minute. At the time of writing the FIFA Football World Cup is being held in Russia. As we watch any one match of 90 minutes by the time the referee blows the final whistle, we will have lost an area of top soil the size of 2,700 football pitches.\n\nToo often we take the World\u2019s resources for granted and soil is no exception. We need to be aware of the importance of soil and the role it plays in environmental matters. The FAO reported that the soil has a key function in absorbing carbon and filtering water. As degradation continues less carbon is stored, the world gets hotter resulting in further degradation of the land and so the cycle continues and problem worsens.\n\nAs the population of the World increases greater pressure is applied to farmers to increase production and at the same time to reduce costs. However, it is self-evident that productivity will become ever more difficult as the amount and quality of the top soil decreases.\n\nIt should be apparent that the matter needs addressing as a major priority particularly as the problem is worse where the population is increasing the quickest e.g. Africa and Asia.\n\nThe problem of soil degradation is mostly due to intensive farming in which there is an over reliance upon chemical fertilisers, deforestation and global warming. [Organicco](https://organicco.uk) can do little about the latter two causes but can assist in the reduction of chemical fertilisers. These not only play a part in soil degradation but also have adverse effects upon the environment when they find their way into rivers and streams.\n\n[Organicco](https://organicco.uk) has spent many years developing its [ecoHero](https://youtu.be/vUPOAKvEj7A) and [ecoDryer](https://youtu.be/pNIg1asEBo4) systems.\n\n[Organicco Presentation](https://reddit.com/link/8uo2t3/video/mx5qr49uit611/player)\n\n# ecoHERO Fertiliser Plant\n\nThe ecoHero system will take kitchen waste, farm waste, fishing industry waste and abattoir waste and by a process of aerobic digestion will convert it into stable organic fertiliser in less than 5 days, sometimes as little as one day. It does not require additional enzymes or chemicals and the main by-product is water vapour and CO2. In future, Organicco plans to capture this CO2 and make a saleable product from it.\n\n# ecoDRYER Digestate Dryer\n\nThe ecoDryer system benefits all Anaerobic Digestion systems by converting the digestate by-product into a quality organic fertiliser. However, its application is not limited to AD operators but can be used to dry a variety of materials such as sludge, animal slurry, manure, woodchip, sawdust, green waste and sewage. The waste goes through the process and converts it into organic fertiliser.\n\nBoth systems offer a closed loop cycle whereby what comes out of the ground initially at the start of the food chain, eventually goes back into the ground as organic fertiliser.\n\n[e](https://preview.redd.it/qq2ipmg4kt611.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b76ff017c07a4dd0253a324e7ea843924901c04)\n\nOrganic fertiliser release nutrients as it breaks down and as it does so the structure of the soil is improved increasing its ability to hold water and nutrients. As well as producing food items free of harmful chemicals the nutrients are necessary for plant growth. They have the benefit of being slow-acting and gentler than the alternative chemical fertiliser. This gentleness means they are less likely to cause users to overfeed and even chemically burn the plants/crops whilst the plants/crops get the benefit of nutrients for growth more evenly over a longer period rather than all at once.\n\nThe organic fertiliser is absorbed by plants/crops by being broken down by soil bacteria and fungi. This means that unlike chemical fertilisers, organic fertilisers are not easily washed away.\n\nOrganic fertilisers help improve soil structure and nutrient content. While chemical fertilisers add water-soluble chemicals, which are either absorbed by the roots or leach away potentially polluting water resources, organic fertilisers add organic matter that helps the soil to retain moisture and nutrients.\n\nWhilst chemical fertilisers do have certain things in their favour in that they provide all the nutrients a plant needs they do have many disadvantages including long term detrimental effects upon the soil. They are a major contributor to soil degradation and the enormous problems that is causing are outlined above.\n\nThe solutions being offered by [Organicco](https://organicco.uk) will not in themselves solve the problems but will help as a move away from chemical to organic fertiliser will be of enormous benefit to the soil.\n\n[Organicco](https://organicco.uk) is seeking major investment to enable it to bring its systems to a global market in much need of them. The company has its product placed in various parts of the World but is looking to deliver much needed solutions quicker than it has up until the present time. The prospect of only 60 years top soil left is a frightening prospect to all who care to consider it and time is of the essence. One thing is certain, we may stand still to consider our options, but time will not.\n\n[https://organicco.uk](https://organicco.uk)\n\n\\#fertiliser, #soil erosion",

I'm only in my first year going back to school. (My first degree was in Fine Art.) Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of people. I love animals, being outdoors, and watching the sunrise on a crisp morning. I've never worked on a farm, though I did volunteer rehabilitating abused and neglected horses in high school. \n\nMy great grandparents had a farm that had been in their family since Oklahoma was first a territory, but they raised the sort of horses that the every man used, (mainly cart, buggy, and plow horses). When the day came that the common man had cars instead of horses and horses were seen as a luxury of the rich, their farm was no longer able to make a living. Much of it was sold and the family all had to find jobs in other sectors.\n\nI've always loved going out there. It's super peaceful, and pretty amazing feeling connected to a piece of land that's been your family for family for nearly 130-140 years. I'd love it if the family I have someday could grow up somewhere that they feel that connected to.\n\nI know gardening is nothing like farming, but always had gardens growing up and loved growing all sorts of fruits, veggies and flowers. I do also know how to keep bees and grow mushrooms. (I got super into the history of the frontier as a kid after my grandpa gave me the foxfire series. I used to do things like weaving and dyeing cloth.)\n\nEven though I know I couldn't make a living raising horses, I love that owning and living on a farm or a ranch would give me the opportunity to \"live in the saddle\" as James Taylor sung. \n\nI don't know how viable it is, but in addition to whatever else we grow, I'd love to have a small apple orchard for pick your own apples, a pumpkin patch for pick your own pumpkins, corn for a corn maze and some christmas trees for cut your own christmas tree. (I'm a total sucker for halloween.)\n\nI'm pretty open to what I'd grow. I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.\n\nI kinda like the idea of growing stuff then processing it onsite to make it into some sort of food item that could be sold online.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this all sounds silly to y'all but I'd really love to get your advice. What are the pros and cons of going into agriculture? Would you suggest switching my major or possibly double majoring? Could continuing in computer science in addition, help me as a farmer/rancher?",

If you want to have your own farm get a degree in one of three things, Crop Science if you want to grow crops, Animal Science if you want to raise livestock, or just plain of Agribusiness if you want to farm period.  \n\nIf you think you can walk out with a degree and start and run a farm with no experience and just a vision, well.....Unless your family is leaving you lots of money or land that is going to be hard. \n\nPersonally, I woudl recommend you get the computer science degree and get a day job while you find a small farm and get started. I work with IT and software vendors a lot. If anything they have a lot more jobs that allow working from home. A day job while you get the farm established and then free lance work at home type stuff until you really are making money.   \n\n>I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.  \n\nThat can be true, but like a lot of things is based on a huge number of assumptions. Statistically, the USDA census of farmers says over 2/3 have to work off farm to eat. It also shows that the failure rate of new farms is super high. It also shows that more than half of farms are losing money year to year. As far as what is economical the local extension office talks about a guy who came in. He wanted to see the per acre data on what was the most profitable in IL. Turns out it is actually parsley at the time. He then shows up late the next summer and wants to know how to harvest and sell the parsley. He grew like 50 or 60 acres of it. He did understand the actual processing, marketing, and sales of parsley. \n\nI would continue your degree path in CS and while you do that take electives in AG and Hort. I would also get involved in the extension office for the university you are at and take whatever seminars, classes,etc they have for new farmers. Go actually work on a farm that is farming how you think you want to farm on a weekends. Talk to the farmers at the farmers markets. \n\nGetting a degree in Ag is not necessarily the best path to a farm. ",

If you like to tinker and to experiment, the above won't be your biggest stumbling block.\n\nInstead, and as someone in a similar position to you, I would say consider learning the business aspect of things (marketing, selling), administrative stuff, regulations etc.\n\nI would also consider starting small scale with small amounts of paid up capital. Move fast, break lots of things, but fail cheaply.",

I\u2019m studying in Israel but I\u2019m American and I want to be marketable in both the US and Israel.  I\u2019m hoping for some advice on which skills are most important to focus on in terms of career development, how I can search for internships and where considering that my university isn\u2019t very helpful with that\u2014and is also located in Israel.  I would like to have internships during my summers visiting home in SoCal, or in various locations.  \n\nI am currently checking out an opportunity to work in a lab in my department on campus, so hopefully that pans out.  \n\nI also have the option to minor in environmental science with the [following courses ](http://departments.agri.huji.ac.il/shnaton/maslul.php?&hug=716&degree=71&maslul=81601), however this means I wouldn\u2019t be able to choose almost any of my courses and I wonder if it means knowing less about soil and water as the environmental courses take the place of usual courses, and whether that would be an advantage or a disadvantage.  The \u201cenvironmental science\u201d would be on my diploma.  I am very interested in the effects of agriculture on the environment and vice versa.  \n\nI would also love to know what redditors in the ag field have done with their degrees.  Especially interested in hydrology and water management/irrigation.  Lastly, is my university a known one in the field?  \n\nThank you for your time!",

A lot of chemical and seed companies have more consultative roles if you want to be client facing.

        "content": "How drones could be used in agriculture? (University project)\nHey everyone, me with a couple of other students need to create and develop a business idea for a project. Our idea would be to use drones to scan crop fields, gather meteorological data. Our plan would be to:\n\nA: predict crop yield and its timing (for seasonal crops such as strawberries this would help to time hiring of seasonal workforce). B: inform on crop illness and dry spots in the fields. C: Give leverage when trying to insure or sell crops because of better data. D: Inform and send images on what part of the crops are ripe.\n\nI am sure there are plenty of technological obstacles, but do you think my mentioned points would be of any use to farmers?\n\nTL:DR How do you think drones could be used in agriculture?",

These are the biggest number of planted acres in North America, I believe.\n\nSo, scouting for overall plant health, growth rate, moisture, plant disease, insect pressure, and weeds should be the targets, I think.  I believe most folks doing this now use infrared technology to spot these things.\n\nChanges over time, derived from multiple trips across the same field will be useful.  As well as some built in software intelligence that can help the farmer know when something is a problem and needs immediate attention versus something to be monitored would be a plus.\n\nObviously the ability of the system to operate autonomously would also be desirable.  You drone needs to be able to fly a pre-programmed path repeatably, and your software should provide field maps not unlike yield data or soil fertility maps now being used along with recommended courses of action.\n\nBeyond that, keep in mind most all farmers are very cost conscious, so your goal is a product that is easier to use than the competition, that provides better results than the present products on the market, and that sells for less than the competition.\n\nOf course, those things are the key to success in any business.  Building a better product with better features that costs less than the competitors.",

Didn't really had a passion for it until recently. I started working for my family company and we are primarily in the sugar cane business. We hire farmers and rent land, also have set up factories to produce sugar, molasses, basically everything sugar cane. We also started to move into cassava business. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever recently I was offered an opportunity to start out on my own with upwards of 2000 hectares for agricultural purposes. I am not too familiar with the actual farming technology and I hardly know where to begin. I don't even know what crops to use. Basically I have to make a proposal and present said proposal to investors. There will be competition too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it's an extremely complex job and requires years of skills and dedication and I don't really expect to be successful, but this past year has really ignited my passion of agriculture and I would like to start on my own. If I can atleast secure 50 hectares of land for agriculture, that would be a really really good start for me. One of the main advantage for me though, is that I'm familiar with industrial 4.0 since I set up the factories production chain as experience and the primary requirement from investors is to apply high agriculture technology. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo bluntly summarize, where should I start? choosing crops? surveying land? machinery? I am really really lost and thanks in advance for any input.  ",

        "content": "Disadvantages of shifting cultivation\n\nThe primary disadvantage of shifting cultivation, also called slash and burn or swidden agriculture, is the destruction of large areas of land, primarily crop fields and tracts of forest. When performed improperly, slash and burn can make once-fertile lands unable to support the new growth of crops and plants. Slash and burn may cause environmental and economic consequences by reducing the growth potential for crops in certain areas, which limits the variety and quantity of agricultural goods farmers can produce. \n\nShifting agriculture is an agricultural practice that dates back to ancient history. Slash and burn was once used throughout the world, and is still used by millions of farmers. Slash and burn involves cultivating fields for production by using a controlled burn. These fires work by burning fields, which eventually return to a natural state over time, and become capable of supporting new life such as native plants and trees.\n\nSlash and burn produces several benefits such as converting biomass or decayed plant matter into ashes and soils rich in nutrients. It can also prevent the infestation of pests and weeds. \n\nShifting agriculture, however, can be an unsustainable method of farming and may leave forest areas unable to support plants, animals and many types of crops.",

        "content": "Mastic: a traditional Greek product making its way into the markets\nMastic is a high quality but less known worldwide product that is produced in Greece and has been developed significantly in many different products such as liquor, gum, snacks, candy, coffee etc. \n(From Wikipedia) \nMastic\u00a0(Greek:\u00a0\u039c\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03b1) is a\u00a0resin\u00a0obtained from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus). In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called \"Arabic gum\" (not to be confused with\u00a0gum arabic) and \"Yemen gum\". In\u00a0Greece, it is known as the \"tears of\u00a0Chios,\" being traditionally produced on that Greek island, and, like other natural resins, is produced in \"tears\" or droplets. \n\nThe trees have small, oval leaves and thin, twisting branches that emerge near the base of the trunk. In July, when there is no threat of rain, farmers clean around the base of the trees and sprinkle a layer of calcium carbonate. This clean landing pad helps to coat the extremely sticky resin when it falls. Next, farmers make small, shallow horizontal incisions into the bark. As the tree tries to heal these wounds, it excretes the anti-inflammatory resin, which drips onto the ground below. The sap is intensely piney, slightly bitter, powerfully sticky and oddly refreshing. Farmers start making incisions close to the base of the trunk, then gradually work up the tree so they aren\u2019t stepping on resin. During the day the resin drops, and after a week it dries enough to be harvested. Sometimes pieces can be as large as bricks! In September, before the rains come, farmers scrape the residual mastiha from the bark, then sweep what is under the tree into a sieve. Now begins the intense cleaning process. First, farmers soak the collection of leaves, dirt and resin in barrels of water, then add soap to make the resin float while the soggy debris sinks. Workers clean each piece of mastiha with a razor-sharp tool to remove dirt stuck in the resin. This part of the process is crucial because farmers receive between $75 and $100 per kilo, depending on the percentage of impurities in the mastiha. Although this process is similar to how it has been harvested for centuries, farmers now have weed whackers and trucks, which reduces the time they spend in the groves. Finally, farmers deliver their cleaned harvest to the cooperative\u2019s processing plant near the city of Chios.\u00a0\n\nDespite the recent fires of 2012 and 2016 burning many hectares of mastic trees (according to unofficial estimates, the fires might have burnt about 40% of the mastic trees), the cooperative (handling exclusively all mastic production) has been successfully entering new markets not only for the mastic liquor but also for snacks, candy, chocolate and coffee with mastic and the popular ELMA mastic gums, all with high digestive value (available in http://mikk.ro/BQar).",

The rail bed will be raised so existing roads used for essential services (think Police, Fire, EMS, etc.) will be dead-ended and they will have to find longer, alternative routes. I'm also hearing talk of the entire length of the rail corridor needing to be fenced in?? Regardless, in places like Japan High Speed Rail is regarded as outdated technology (they have been doing it 25-30 years), and unlike Japan Ontario does not have the population to support such an expensive government vanity project. There are a lot of local farm organizations fighting against this right now. At best, it will completely demolish 4,000 workable acres of farmland, and our population isn't decreasing any time soon, so if we don't save this land, where will our food be produced?

It will be harvested later that the winter wheat, a bit, say August to September timeframe.  It could be hot or mild during that time but it will be dry most years, and again, susceptible to fire.\n\nContrast all this with corn or soybeans which are spring seeded and harvested in the fall.  The fall may be drier on average than the summer, but the temps are much cooler.\n\nCorn and soybeans can burn however and it happens somewhere nearly every year, but it is more common to have dangerous fires in wheat.",

        "content": "Disadvantages of shifting cultivation\n\nThe primary disadvantage of shifting cultivation, also called slash and burn or swidden agriculture, is the destruction of large areas of land, primarily crop fields and tracts of forest. When performed improperly, slash and burn can make once-fertile lands unable to support the new growth of crops and plants. Slash and burn may cause environmental and economic consequences by reducing the growth potential for crops in certain areas, which limits the variety and quantity of agricultural goods farmers can produce. \n\nShifting agriculture is an agricultural practice that dates back to ancient history. Slash and burn was once used throughout the world, and is still used by millions of farmers. Slash and burn involves cultivating fields for production by using a controlled burn. These fires work by burning fields, which eventually return to a natural state over time, and become capable of supporting new life such as native plants and trees.\n\nSlash and burn produces several benefits such as converting biomass or decayed plant matter into ashes and soils rich in nutrients. It can also prevent the infestation of pests and weeds. \n\nShifting agriculture, however, can be an unsustainable method of farming and may leave forest areas unable to support plants, animals and many types of crops.",

        "content": "Mastic: a traditional Greek product making its way into the markets\nMastic is a high quality but less known worldwide product that is produced in Greece and has been developed significantly in many different products such as liquor, gum, snacks, candy, coffee etc. \n(From Wikipedia) \nMastic\u00a0(Greek:\u00a0\u039c\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03b1) is a\u00a0resin\u00a0obtained from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus). In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called \"Arabic gum\" (not to be confused with\u00a0gum arabic) and \"Yemen gum\". In\u00a0Greece, it is known as the \"tears of\u00a0Chios,\" being traditionally produced on that Greek island, and, like other natural resins, is produced in \"tears\" or droplets. \n\nThe trees have small, oval leaves and thin, twisting branches that emerge near the base of the trunk. In July, when there is no threat of rain, farmers clean around the base of the trees and sprinkle a layer of calcium carbonate. This clean landing pad helps to coat the extremely sticky resin when it falls. Next, farmers make small, shallow horizontal incisions into the bark. As the tree tries to heal these wounds, it excretes the anti-inflammatory resin, which drips onto the ground below. The sap is intensely piney, slightly bitter, powerfully sticky and oddly refreshing. Farmers start making incisions close to the base of the trunk, then gradually work up the tree so they aren\u2019t stepping on resin. During the day the resin drops, and after a week it dries enough to be harvested. Sometimes pieces can be as large as bricks! In September, before the rains come, farmers scrape the residual mastiha from the bark, then sweep what is under the tree into a sieve. Now begins the intense cleaning process. First, farmers soak the collection of leaves, dirt and resin in barrels of water, then add soap to make the resin float while the soggy debris sinks. Workers clean each piece of mastiha with a razor-sharp tool to remove dirt stuck in the resin. This part of the process is crucial because farmers receive between $75 and $100 per kilo, depending on the percentage of impurities in the mastiha. Although this process is similar to how it has been harvested for centuries, farmers now have weed whackers and trucks, which reduces the time they spend in the groves. Finally, farmers deliver their cleaned harvest to the cooperative\u2019s processing plant near the city of Chios.\u00a0\n\nDespite the recent fires of 2012 and 2016 burning many hectares of mastic trees (according to unofficial estimates, the fires might have burnt about 40% of the mastic trees), the cooperative (handling exclusively all mastic production) has been successfully entering new markets not only for the mastic liquor but also for snacks, candy, chocolate and coffee with mastic and the popular ELMA mastic gums, all with high digestive value (available in http://mikk.ro/BQar).",

The rail bed will be raised so existing roads used for essential services (think Police, Fire, EMS, etc.) will be dead-ended and they will have to find longer, alternative routes. I'm also hearing talk of the entire length of the rail corridor needing to be fenced in?? Regardless, in places like Japan High Speed Rail is regarded as outdated technology (they have been doing it 25-30 years), and unlike Japan Ontario does not have the population to support such an expensive government vanity project. There are a lot of local farm organizations fighting against this right now. At best, it will completely demolish 4,000 workable acres of farmland, and our population isn't decreasing any time soon, so if we don't save this land, where will our food be produced? Anyways, just trying to get real information into the hands of the people so we know what we're up against. ",

My dad and I aren't super close.. but he has told me a little about it and he absolutely loves his job and the work he has done. \n\nHe and the CED at his office have both talked to me about becoming a CED as a career at my young age.. but I haven't gotten much info about timeframe, program details, what the process is like, salary, etc. Was wondering if anyone here has any experience or could shed some light on any of that for me.

In addition to salary, also a great set of benefits are available. Also lots of time off and generally no nights or weekends. If you want to be a CED, you first have to go through a 9-12 month training program. It may be a good idea to be a PT for a few years before applying for a CED position, this may increase your competitiveness for the position if your having trouble getting a CED offer. Some downsides to working with the FSA? Well, don't expect to be out in the field much at all. Your work will be very much administration - expect your days to be filled with government paperwork. The CED position is better than the PT position in terms of variability of job tasks - PTs can often have very repetitive and sedentary jobs. If you really want to be in the field more, then the NRCS may be the better government ag-related agency to work for. However, if you can stand lots of policy, procedure, and bureaucracy, than the FSA might be for you!",

I'm only in my first year going back to school. (My first degree was in Fine Art.) Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of people. I love animals, being outdoors, and watching the sunrise on a crisp morning. I've never worked on a farm, though I did volunteer rehabilitating abused and neglected horses in high school. \n\nMy great grandparents had a farm that had been in their family since Oklahoma was first a territory, but they raised the sort of horses that the every man used, (mainly cart, buggy, and plow horses). When the day came that the common man had cars instead of horses and horses were seen as a luxury of the rich, their farm was no longer able to make a living. Much of it was sold and the family all had to find jobs in other sectors.\n\nI've always loved going out there. It's super peaceful, and pretty amazing feeling connected to a piece of land that's been your family for family for nearly 130-140 years. I'd love it if the family I have someday could grow up somewhere that they feel that connected to.\n\nI know gardening is nothing like farming, but always had gardens growing up and loved growing all sorts of fruits, veggies and flowers. I do also know how to keep bees and grow mushrooms. (I got super into the history of the frontier as a kid after my grandpa gave me the foxfire series. I used to do things like weaving and dyeing cloth.)\n\nEven though I know I couldn't make a living raising horses, I love that owning and living on a farm or a ranch would give me the opportunity to \"live in the saddle\" as James Taylor sung. \n\nI don't know how viable it is, but in addition to whatever else we grow, I'd love to have a small apple orchard for pick your own apples, a pumpkin patch for pick your own pumpkins, corn for a corn maze and some christmas trees for cut your own christmas tree. (I'm a total sucker for halloween.)\n\nI'm pretty open to what I'd grow. I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.\n\nI kinda like the idea of growing stuff then processing it onsite to make it into some sort of food item that could be sold online.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this all sounds silly to y'all but I'd really love to get your advice. What are the pros and cons of going into agriculture? Would you suggest switching my major or possibly double majoring? Could continuing in computer science in addition, help me as a farmer/rancher?",

You see painting of a farm, a caricature of a farm.\n\nFirst, you do not need a degree to farm. Just like you do not need a degree to write poetry or paint. It may help in certain situations, but the reality is that many painters are self taught and no amount of college will help you be a poet if you lack talent. \n\nSecond, do you want a career in agriculture or are you just dreaming of a farm? There is a difference. If you want to have your own farm get a degree in one of three things, Crop Science if you want to grow crops, Animal Science if you want to raise livestock, or just plain of Agribusiness if you want to farm period.  \n\nIf you think you can walk out with a degree and start and run a farm with no experience and just a vision, well.....Unless your family is leaving you lots of money or land that is going to be hard. \n\nPersonally, I woudl recommend you get the computer science degree and get a day job while you find a small farm and get started. I work with IT and software vendors a lot. If anything they have a lot more jobs that allow working from home. A day job while you get the farm established and then free lance work at home type stuff until you really are making money.   \n\n>I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.  \n\nThat can be true, but like a lot of things is based on a huge number of assumptions. Statistically, the USDA census of farmers says over 2/3 have to work off farm to eat. It also shows that the failure rate of new farms is super high. It also shows that more than half of farms are losing money year to year. As far as what is economical the local extension office talks about a guy who came in. He wanted to see the per acre data on what was the most profitable in IL. Turns out it is actually parsley at the time. He then shows up late the next summer and wants to know how to harvest and sell the parsley. He grew like 50 or 60 acres of it. He did understand the actual processing, marketing, and sales of parsley. \n\nI would continue your degree path in CS and while you do that take electives in AG and Hort. I would also get involved in the extension office for the university you are at and take whatever seminars, classes,etc they have for new farmers. Go actually work on a farm that is farming how you think you want to farm on a weekends. Talk to the farmers at the farmers markets. \n\nGetting a degree in Ag is not necessarily the best path to a farm. ",

If you like to tinker and to experiment, the above won't be your biggest stumbling block.\n\nInstead, and as someone in a similar position to you, I would say consider learning the business aspect of things (marketing, selling), administrative stuff, regulations etc.\n\nI would also consider starting small scale with small amounts of paid up capital. Move fast, break lots of things, but fail cheaply.",

                "content": "It depends. I am working full time and just finished a 2 year AAS in Agri-Hort Business. I learned a lot to apply to my farm and it gave a piece of paper for when we go to the bank in a year or two for a bank loan to get bigger. \n\nHowever, I have a pretty good day job. The house we bought is actually a farm with 25 acres. We are growing vegetables and starting to sell this year at farmers markets and to restaurants. We are also adding raised beds with perennial herbs. We have chickens and sell nest eggs off the farm. The wife has taken a leave of absence from her job(retail) and probably won't go back. I hope to only have to work for a couple more years till I can take my cash balance retirement and walk. Then we plan to run the farm full time. For us the key is trying to NOT have to get the bank loan or to minimize it. We have a reasonable business plan, good credit, and a market. But I still don't like the risk. So we will get ourselves well positioned before we make the loan leap. That would be to buy more acreage and put in a bunch of greenhouses and Hops trellises. \n\nAt like a decade and half older than you I am worried it is a little late to start a new career path, but fuck it. \n\nHere is the bottom line: Decide what is maximum level of security you are willing to give up NOW for the family now to have something maybe better LATER. I would say some combination of things might be in order:\n\nFirst: if you are working don't quit the day job. Look into local community/junior college ag programs. See if they have \"certificates\" for stuff that they offer while working toward a degree. Get a certificate a few classes at a time. \n\nSecond get with the state extension service office. See what free classes and programs they have. Learn as much as you can. Get out and meet people in ag. This will help you with knowledge and to maybe meet someone who can help you with the next phase. \n\nThird: Get a part time job. Find a landscaper. Offer to help on nights and weekends or when you have time. maybe just a day or two a week or pick up slack during busy times. OR find a farmer that needs help at planting time or harvest time. maybe the local dairy goat farm needs someone to help pull new fence or spring clean out a deep littered barn. You get experience and start to get ideas about what you really want to do. \n\nForth: make the leap. Two years in you have a basic horticulture or agriculture production certificate form the college, you knwo a bunch of guys, and one of them needs someone to work or lead a work crew. You jump from the day job to landscaping or staff at the green house. \n\nNow you are working in the industry. Keep working and learning. Keep taking the college classes. Now you can finnish out the business classes and math. Get that degree. \n\nLast phase is now you have several years experience in the business working for someone, you have a AAS, start your own place or buy into one. I see several businesses and farms that sell or get bought out every year. Growers want to retire. Someone get s sick and can't herd dairy goats anymore, or whatever. Maybe instead of a full cold start you buy into a turnkey operation. \n\n\nIt is doable. Just take it in little bites. ",

                "content": "31 + 2 years for an associates degree seems risky when the end goal is to own your own landscaping or other related agriculture business, and you already have some student debt.\n\nHow old are your kids, in 3-5 years would 1 or more be able to help you run a lawn mower or a leaf blower, etc?\n\nI think your time would be better spent working for a landscape crew or on the grounds crew for a golf course. Do that for 2-3 years and make money, rather than more debt for the associates, and learn on the job. So about the same amount of time, gaining knowledge, hit up the local library for as many horticultural books as you can and be paid for your time.\n\nIf you have cash to pay for the associates degree that\u2019s great! Leave that money in a money market account, (low return but zero risk for 2-3 years), and use that to purchase equipment when the time comes.\n\nI am 35, and am about to start farming myself. If I were in your shoes, I would start with the golf courses and ask to speak with the head grounds keeper, tell them your Elevator Pitch of a 2-3 year goal to start your own XYZ business and that you are a sponge eager to learn all that you can, and ask for a job that would allow you to learn AND in 6-12 months be responsible for managing a small crew or fully responsible for some aspect of the work. Yes, ask for management opportunities, and you may add that you would do it without increased pay. \n\nSo much of owning your own business is managing all the small details. \n\nI have worked fir one golf course and knowing the guys there, I think the head grounds guy would have gone for this. A lot of the employees were college or high school students. Having a 25-35 year old come in, wanting to learn, and could help heard the cats would probably have been a great deal for him.\n\nBasically your asking for an apprenticeship. Willing to work for less pay, with the expectation that you will be actively educated, and ultimately get more responsibility than a \u201cnormal\u201d employe would, in a shorter amount of time, because both you and the \u201cboss\u201d, know it\u2019s for a specific amount of time.\n\nGolf courses also have the advantage of working with golfers who will appreciate your work, and could become your landscape/yard maintenance clients.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t any golf courses in your area, I would research every landscape company and garden/nursery/greenhouse in your region. Like deep research, try and know all the competition and each companies history, services provided, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and their internal narrative as you can before you go and talk with anyone.  \n\nThis serves multiple purposes. First and foremost all of these companies will either be your competition, your vendors, or depending on what route you take they could be your customers. \n\nThis also gives you the opportunity to learn who among this group may have the heart of a teacher and be willing to take on an apprentice who may go on to start a company that would compete with them. However when you sit down to talk with them about your apprenticeship idea and your goal of owning your own company in 2-3 years you can communicate how you know who all the regional players are and that your intention is not to compete against who ever trains you, but to further help them stomp out all the other completion. \n\nIt\u2019s been my experience in agricultural and manufacturing circles that the honorable companies and individuals are always willing to help people and competitors out in nearly anyway they can. They know business is difficult and that they were helped along the way. They also know that they don\u2019t want to be successful at what they do by poisoning the well for others. They want to be the best because they are the best. \n\nIn both of the examples above, golf course or commercial apprenticeship, you will be showing the leadership necessary to own your own business in the future. People may tell you no, and wish you luck, but you will have made a positive impression, and will have begun the process of professionally networking within the sector you want to work in. Maybe your plans change and you don\u2019t own your own business but 2-3 years from now your not finishing your degree and looking to start, but are instead taking over more responsibility with your current employer when the apprenticeship ends. Or you are afforded the opportunity to purchase your mentors landscape company, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI think these options give you more opportunities than the associates degree would in the long term.\n\nBlessings and good luck. \n\n\n\n\n",

                "content": "As other people have already stated, make sure that you get internships during the summer and try to find agricultural work during the year as well. I had a very difficult time in finding full-time employment after graduation because I had not been able to secure an internship before graduating. This was due to my lack of experience in my field, a sort of Catch 22. Definitely use any connections you have, including your professors. I applied to a position and my advisor put in a good word for me, and that made all the difference in getting the job.\n\nMake sure to explore opportunities where it is possible. You can sometimes find work as a teaching assistant, or an undergraduate laboratory assistant while in college. This experience looks good on your resume, and gives you a fair idea of what graduate school would be like. I had not explored the possibility of graduate school until I got a summer job as a laboratory assistant for a different university. So don't rule anything out until you have taken a step in that direction. I never thought that I would enjoy research, but it turns out that I do!\n\nAs far as different types of jobs... There are private companies that you can work for, such as Monsanto or Pioneer or small co-ops, or you could work for the public sector. I went for public-sector (federal government) work because it actually paid more than private for my area, and the positions are very secure. You don't have to worry about getting fired as long as you're trying. I'm not lazy by any means, but it gives me a sense of relief to know that I can't be fired at the drop of a hat.\n\nYou really need to evaluate your situation and decide what you want in life. Those people that go into sales are driven by it, but have to work long hours and travel quite a bit. Most small co-ops work very long hours too. Joining a company like Monsanto or pioneer might be difficult without an advanced degree, but it is certainly not impossible. I have seen many people with bachelor's degrees get in with Monsanto.\nAlso think about any relationships that you might have with the people around you. Do you want to stay close to your partner or family? Try to figure out what types of jobs are available in the areas that you want to be in. Working for the federal government requires you too sometimes sign a mobility agreement. This essentially means that you have to move to advance up the ladder. But the advantage of this is that you get a lot of good experience, and you can move up quite quickly if you're willing to bite the bullet and move around. It's also pretty exciting sometimes.\n\nTry not to box yourself in though. Try to expand your knowledge base as best as you can so that you can fit a variety of jobs. Take it from someone in the soil science field who has seen soil scientists specialize in little-used areas. You don't want to make this harder for yourself. A little specialization can be good, but too much can back you into a corner that is difficult to come out of.",

The city of Manila had almost been totally destroyed in WWII. Population grew at around 3% a year, and the economy could barely keep up. Per capita incomes were a fraction of those in America, and the gap was growing even larger. Localized outbreaks of famine were common, and the average Filipino consumed 1,790 calories a day, 18% less than the caloric minimum. The hunger and poverty fueled social rebellion, and thousands of peasants were in armed revolt against the pro-American central government.\n\nIn 1798, Economist Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the exponential growth of human population would inevitably lead to mass hunger and famine. By the 1950s, it appeared those predictions were coming true. Famine and instability increasingly plagued large chunks of the developing. Rapid developments in public health allowed many countries to grow by over three percent a year, and food production could not keep pace. Rice is the most food crop in both the world and the Philippines, and both needed a miracle in rice production.\n\nhttps://content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/Phillipines_-_Green_Revolution.mp3\n",

If you get the same change by breeding or mutation, there is no regulation necessary. **The most precise and directed method of introducing known genetic change is massively over-regulated.** New discoveries have created livestock immune from insidious disease that cannot be deployed. This means little incentive for research or innovation in livestock in the USA. Canada, Brazil, Argentina and others are doing this work with the same rigorous deregulation as is used in crops. The USA farmer, rancher and consumer will lose access to the best genetics and will not be able to compete. There is a petition that you can sign to show support for change, as various researchers seek to correct the rules.

I've been working as a frontend web developer in the finance world for a couple years now. It's been fun, I've learned a ton, but there are a lot of important problems to solve out there, and the problems of the finance world are ranking lower and lower on my list as other more pressing things, climate change especially, start to get more urgent and dire.\n\nSoftware engineering is an occupation that has so much power to influence and shape the world in exciting and important ways, so I'm trying to do some research on areas where I could use my SE skills to start pushing the world towards a more sustainable future.\n\nSustainable agriculture is one thing that excites me in particular. I've always really liked the story of the Haber process, which is how we extract nitrogen from the atmosphere to use as fertilizer, which in turn is one of the main reasons why we can feed 9 billion people on this planet today. It's such a cool case study for how science can improve the world, and software is another tool which can impact food production in a positive way. \n\nI'm hoping that you all have some advice on getting into the industry from the software side of things, or maybe have some interesting directions for me to look in as I figure out the lay of the land. Companies, job titles, tech stacks, even anything tangentially related to the industry would be golden as I try to figure out which way is up! Self driving tractors, weather satellites, AI, I am all ears. \n\nFor some context: I'm currently living in NYC, although I'm looking to relocate within the US, especially the west.\n\nThank you!",

There\u2019s an enormous amount of data collected about the millions of acres used for farming - satellite imagery, data collected from planters, combines, harvesters, sprayers etc, farm logistics and management systems. The list goes on. Turning that data into software to help farmers is a pretty fun problem to solve.\n\nI\u2019ve worked for two of the bigger corporations, really just by chance.

Have a willingness and ability to stay mentally limber/plastic. B willing to step outside the comfort zone into something close, but different. \n\nC. Network, go to conferences, present at them when asked. You meet and greet and that is how you will find out that X place needs a guy. It is how you get asked to join industry working groups, etc. \n\nD. Never stop learning. IF you have the degree in Tech, do not be afraid to get into a Community college and add a AS in some aspect of agri-hort to broaden your hiring appeal. A Masters is also great thing. But don't pass up other professional certifications or trainings.

Then you need to jump through 6/5 or 6 other hoops.\n\nI truly believe that it's a matter of a few years before the legalities change and I would like to act now on setting myself up.\n\nDoes anyone have experience growing it?\nHow small of a grow operation could I start with? \nAre there typical barriers to entry that the novice like me does not expect?\n\nThanks for your responses in advance.",

        "content": "Considering switching my major to Agriculture. Pro/Cons?\nI'm 33 and currently going back to school. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Biology at WSU Tri-Cities. I'm only in my first year going back to school. (My first degree was in Fine Art.) Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of people. I love animals, being outdoors, and watching the sunrise on a crisp morning. I've never worked on a farm, though I did volunteer rehabilitating abused and neglected horses in high school. \n\nMy great grandparents had a farm that had been in their family since Oklahoma was first a territory, but they raised the sort of horses that the every man used, (mainly cart, buggy, and plow horses). When the day came that the common man had cars instead of horses and horses were seen as a luxury of the rich, their farm was no longer able to make a living. Much of it was sold and the family all had to find jobs in other sectors.\n\nI've always loved going out there. It's super peaceful, and pretty amazing feeling connected to a piece of land that's been your family for family for nearly 130-140 years. I'd love it if the family I have someday could grow up somewhere that they feel that connected to.\n\nI know gardening is nothing like farming, but always had gardens growing up and loved growing all sorts of fruits, veggies and flowers. I do also know how to keep bees and grow mushrooms. (I got super into the history of the frontier as a kid after my grandpa gave me the foxfire series. I used to do things like weaving and dyeing cloth.)\n\nEven though I know I couldn't make a living raising horses, I love that owning and living on a farm or a ranch would give me the opportunity to \"live in the saddle\" as James Taylor sung. \n\nI don't know how viable it is, but in addition to whatever else we grow, I'd love to have a small apple orchard for pick your own apples, a pumpkin patch for pick your own pumpkins, corn for a corn maze and some christmas trees for cut your own christmas tree. (I'm a total sucker for halloween.)\n\nI'm pretty open to what I'd grow. I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.\n\nI kinda like the idea of growing stuff then processing it onsite to make it into some sort of food item that could be sold online.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this all sounds silly to y'all but I'd really love to get your advice. What are the pros and cons of going into agriculture? Would you suggest switching my major or possibly double majoring? Could continuing in computer science in addition, help me as a farmer/rancher?",

                "content": "First, you have a very romantic version of a farming in your head. What you see is not a farm career or something that exists as a farm business actually. You see painting of a farm, a caricature of a farm.\n\nFirst, you do not need a degree to farm. Just like you do not need a degree to write poetry or paint. It may help in certain situations, but the reality is that many painters are self taught and no amount of college will help you be a poet if you lack talent. \n\nSecond, do you want a career in agriculture or are you just dreaming of a farm? There is a difference. If you want to have your own farm get a degree in one of three things, Crop Science if you want to grow crops, Animal Science if you want to raise livestock, or just plain of Agribusiness if you want to farm period.  \n\nIf you think you can walk out with a degree and start and run a farm with no experience and just a vision, well.....Unless your family is leaving you lots of money or land that is going to be hard. \n\nPersonally, I woudl recommend you get the computer science degree and get a day job while you find a small farm and get started. I work with IT and software vendors a lot. If anything they have a lot more jobs that allow working from home. A day job while you get the farm established and then free lance work at home type stuff until you really are making money.   \n\n>I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.  \n\nThat can be true, but like a lot of things is based on a huge number of assumptions. Statistically, the USDA census of farmers says over 2/3 have to work off farm to eat. It also shows that the failure rate of new farms is super high. It also shows that more than half of farms are losing money year to year. As far as what is economical the local extension office talks about a guy who came in. He wanted to see the per acre data on what was the most profitable in IL. Turns out it is actually parsley at the time. He then shows up late the next summer and wants to know how to harvest and sell the parsley. He grew like 50 or 60 acres of it. He did understand the actual processing, marketing, and sales of parsley. \n\nI would continue your degree path in CS and while you do that take electives in AG and Hort. I would also get involved in the extension office for the university you are at and take whatever seminars, classes,etc they have for new farmers. Go actually work on a farm that is farming how you think you want to farm on a weekends. Talk to the farmers at the farmers markets. \n\nGetting a degree in Ag is not necessarily the best path to a farm. ",

If you like to tinker and to experiment, the above won't be your biggest stumbling block.\n\nInstead, and as someone in a similar position to you, I would say consider learning the business aspect of things (marketing, selling), administrative stuff, regulations etc.\n\nI would also consider starting small scale with small amounts of paid up capital. Move fast, break lots of things, but fail cheaply.",

I'm still young in my career, but at 30, I have negotiated a great position for myself.  I won't say it's guaranteed that you'll find what you want, but ag is a blossoming sector with a lot of opportunity. \n\nMy best advice is that if you are passionate about ag, do whatever you can now before jumping in head first.  If it's engineering, try tinkering with some tractors or hobbiest hydroponic systems.  If it's actual farming, try getting a community plot, or volunteering at a small farm operation to see what it's really like.  Best of luck!",

I have some ag knowledge from growing up in a farming community, and my father has been a Program Technician for as long as I can remember. While working I have managed to get my Associates and am 2 semesters from my Bachelors. I have been trying to get into the USDA office forever and an opening finally arose the town over from mine as a full-time PT. Applied, got referred, potentially interviewing next week. I think this is a great opportunity to get my foot in the door as far as learning the programs and what goes on in the agency. My dad and I aren't super close.. but he has told me a little about it and he absolutely loves his job and the work he has done. \n\nHe and the CED at his office have both talked to me about becoming a CED as a career at my young age.. but I haven't gotten much info about timeframe, program details, what the process is like, salary, etc. Was wondering if anyone here has any experience or could shed some light on any of that for me. Any help is appreciated!",

Most CED positions currently max out at a CO-12 pay grade (currently ranging from $76,721 - $99,741 depending on the time in service). That figure also incorporates a base locality pay. In addition to salary, also a great set of benefits are available. Also lots of time off and generally no nights or weekends. If you want to be a CED, you first have to go through a 9-12 month training program. It may be a good idea to be a PT for a few years before applying for a CED position, this may increase your competitiveness for the position if your having trouble getting a CED offer. Some downsides to working with the FSA? Well, don't expect to be out in the field much at all. Your work will be very much administration - expect your days to be filled with government paperwork. The CED position is better than the PT position in terms of variability of job tasks - PTs can often have very repetitive and sedentary jobs. If you really want to be in the field more, then the NRCS may be the better government ag-related agency to work for. However, if you can stand lots of policy, procedure, and bureaucracy, than the FSA might be for you!",

The farmers of the American midwest practice some of the most technologically sophisticated agriculture in the world. American agriculture is fully mechanized, makes heavy use agriculture inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and reliant upon mono-cropping highly lucrative crops such as corn and soy. This is in stark contrast to Tanzania, where many farmers use the same implements they would have a thousand years ago, and where yields are a fraction of what they are in the United States. It is easy to assume that these poor peasants are a dead weight on agricultural development, and the transforming the Tanzanian economy will require replacing peasant farming with modern agriculture. Development policy under colonial rule, socialist rule, and the current capitalist government have all been based on these assumptions. Today\u2019s podcast will be looking at the disastrous consequences of these assumptions.\n\nThe United Kingdom, the colonial power that ruled Tanzania, was suffering from major shortages and inflation in the aftermath of WWII. The government of the time, decided investing massively in large scale peanut farming in Tanzania would both help alleviate cooking oil shortages in the UK and bring agricultural development to Tanzania. Between 1948 and 1951 the United Kingdom through the the state controlled Overseas Food Corporation invested $2.9 billion in modern currency. From the beginning, the plan was a fiasco. The Port of Dar es Salaam did not have the equipment to handle the massive influx of agricultural equipment and the only railroad connecting the selected site to Dar es Salaam was washed out in floods. The OFC failed to plan for the massive influx of workers clearing and preparing the land for farming, forcing many into unsanitary tent cities. Most importantly, the farming itself proved to be far more difficult than expected. The American tractors broke down in transportation. The high clay and quartz content of the soil baked into something near concrete, wearing the plough shares down. Most famously, the OFC attempted retrofit WWII tanks into agricultural bulldozers. In the end, total peanut production was minimal. The groundnut scheme was only one of many failed British agricultural programs in Tanzania. Many tried to micromanage the lives of farmers, telling them how to farm their land and raise their livestock, while having little idea of the realities of farming in Tanzania.\n\nTanzania gained its independence from Great Britain in 1961, and its new socialist leadership under Julius Nyerere promised a completely new direction, guided by the ideology of Ujamaa (which translates to family-ness in Swahili) a form of African socialism. However, the new administration inherited many of the biases of the previous colonial government. The socialist government intervened far more forcefully into the lives of ordinary farmers, the most intense example of which was uprooting up to 13 million farmers from their traditional farmsteads and concentrating them in large villages. The official justification was that it was easier to provide health and education services, yet from an agricultural perspective they were a failure. An example of this failure was that of Mbarali Farms, a large rice farm created as an aid project by the Chinese government between 1971 and 1977, investing approximately $82 million in current dollars, to construct a highly mechanized rice farm. However, after transfer to Tanzanian authorities, the rice farms suffered from the same problems as the groundnut scheme. The Mbarali Farms mechanized methods struggled to manage water levels and weeding, and yields at Mbarali Farms decreased by 60% between 1980 and 1989. Nearby African peasants, using traditional benefits and not benefiting from foreign aid, had rice yields about 15% higher than those at Mbarali Farms.\n\nHowever, the same attitudes towards farmers have changed slowly under the pro-market governments that took over after Nyerere stepped down from power. An example of this can be seen in the government of Tanzania\u2019s encouragement of large scale global agro-business to grab land, to farm with modern methods. One example of these failures are Sun Biofuels acquisition of 20,000 acres of uncultivated forest in the region of Kisarawe. The local farmers made use of this land for water, lumber and other forest products. Sun Biofuels promised 4,000 jobs for locals, and promised to invest in roads, hospitals and rural infrastructure and so the farmers allowed to farm this land for only a nominal fee. The jatropha plantations suffered the same fate as the Groundnut Scheme and Mbarali farms, and the jatropha crops failed under Tanzanian conditions. A collapse of global commodity prices, and the jatropha plants lack of resilience to drought and local pests doomed the project. Moreover, only 44 jobs were created for locals, as the project relied heavily upon mechanized methods. The land did not revert to the farmers after the collapse of the jatropha crops, and was acquired by Mtanga Foods, a Tanzanian agrobusiness company to raise cattle.\n\nForeign investment, modern technology, and mechanization all play an important role in modernizing Tanzanian agriculture. However, these methods need to be adapted to Tanzanian conditions, and especially the needs of Tanzanian farmers if they are to succeed. Farmers need access to fertilizer, irrigation, and high yielding seeds to succeed. Moreover, they need access to quality extension services that respects the farmers understanding of the land he farms, and adapts the latest technology to the situation on the ground. In recent decades, government policy in Tanzania has been moving in this direction, and the results have been impressive. Between 2006 and 2016, maize production has increased 71%, rice production 247%, and sweet potato production 275%. The results match those in green revolution countries such as India and Indonesia. Tanzanian farmers, if given the right tools and incentives, can match farmers anywhere in the world for productivity.  \n\n\n \n\n[http://wealthofnationspodcast.com/](http://wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/211-2/](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/211-2/)\n\n[https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/tanzania\\_-\\_agriculture.mp3](https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/tanzania_-_agriculture.mp3)",

        "content": "Considering switching my major to Agriculture. Pro/Cons?\nI'm 33 and currently going back to school. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Biology at WSU Tri-Cities. I'm only in my first year going back to school. (My first degree was in Fine Art.) Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of people. I love animals, being outdoors, and watching the sunrise on a crisp morning. I've never worked on a farm, though I did volunteer rehabilitating abused and neglected horses in high school. \n\nMy great grandparents had a farm that had been in their family since Oklahoma was first a territory, but they raised the sort of horses that the every man used, (mainly cart, buggy, and plow horses). When the day came that the common man had cars instead of horses and horses were seen as a luxury of the rich, their farm was no longer able to make a living. Much of it was sold and the family all had to find jobs in other sectors.\n\nI've always loved going out there. It's super peaceful, and pretty amazing feeling connected to a piece of land that's been your family for family for nearly 130-140 years. I'd love it if the family I have someday could grow up somewhere that they feel that connected to.\n\nI know gardening is nothing like farming, but always had gardens growing up and loved growing all sorts of fruits, veggies and flowers. I do also know how to keep bees and grow mushrooms. (I got super into the history of the frontier as a kid after my grandpa gave me the foxfire series. I used to do things like weaving and dyeing cloth.)\n\nEven though I know I couldn't make a living raising horses, I love that owning and living on a farm or a ranch would give me the opportunity to \"live in the saddle\" as James Taylor sung. \n\nI don't know how viable it is, but in addition to whatever else we grow, I'd love to have a small apple orchard for pick your own apples, a pumpkin patch for pick your own pumpkins, corn for a corn maze and some christmas trees for cut your own christmas tree. (I'm a total sucker for halloween.)\n\nI'm pretty open to what I'd grow. I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.\n\nI kinda like the idea of growing stuff then processing it onsite to make it into some sort of food item that could be sold online.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this all sounds silly to y'all but I'd really love to get your advice. What are the pros and cons of going into agriculture? Would you suggest switching my major or possibly double majoring? Could continuing in computer science in addition, help me as a farmer/rancher?",

                "content": "First, you have a very romantic version of a farming in your head. What you see is not a farm career or something that exists as a farm business actually. You see painting of a farm, a caricature of a farm.\n\nFirst, you do not need a degree to farm. Just like you do not need a degree to write poetry or paint. It may help in certain situations, but the reality is that many painters are self taught and no amount of college will help you be a poet if you lack talent. \n\nSecond, do you want a career in agriculture or are you just dreaming of a farm? There is a difference. If you want to have your own farm get a degree in one of three things, Crop Science if you want to grow crops, Animal Science if you want to raise livestock, or just plain of Agribusiness if you want to farm period.  \n\nIf you think you can walk out with a degree and start and run a farm with no experience and just a vision, well.....Unless your family is leaving you lots of money or land that is going to be hard. \n\nPersonally, I woudl recommend you get the computer science degree and get a day job while you find a small farm and get started. I work with IT and software vendors a lot. If anything they have a lot more jobs that allow working from home. A day job while you get the farm established and then free lance work at home type stuff until you really are making money.   \n\n>I've read recently that flowers are one of the best things economically for new farms just starting out.  \n\nThat can be true, but like a lot of things is based on a huge number of assumptions. Statistically, the USDA census of farmers says over 2/3 have to work off farm to eat. It also shows that the failure rate of new farms is super high. It also shows that more than half of farms are losing money year to year. As far as what is economical the local extension office talks about a guy who came in. He wanted to see the per acre data on what was the most profitable in IL. Turns out it is actually parsley at the time. He then shows up late the next summer and wants to know how to harvest and sell the parsley. He grew like 50 or 60 acres of it. He did understand the actual processing, marketing, and sales of parsley. \n\nI would continue your degree path in CS and while you do that take electives in AG and Hort. I would also get involved in the extension office for the university you are at and take whatever seminars, classes,etc they have for new farmers. Go actually work on a farm that is farming how you think you want to farm on a weekends. Talk to the farmers at the farmers markets. \n\nGetting a degree in Ag is not necessarily the best path to a farm. ",

If you like to tinker and to experiment, the above won't be your biggest stumbling block.\n\nInstead, and as someone in a similar position to you, I would say consider learning the business aspect of things (marketing, selling), administrative stuff, regulations etc.\n\nI would also consider starting small scale with small amounts of paid up capital. Move fast, break lots of things, but fail cheaply.",

                "content": "It depends. I am working full time and just finished a 2 year AAS in Agri-Hort Business. I learned a lot to apply to my farm and it gave a piece of paper for when we go to the bank in a year or two for a bank loan to get bigger. \n\nHowever, I have a pretty good day job. The house we bought is actually a farm with 25 acres. We are growing vegetables and starting to sell this year at farmers markets and to restaurants. We are also adding raised beds with perennial herbs. We have chickens and sell nest eggs off the farm. The wife has taken a leave of absence from her job(retail) and probably won't go back. I hope to only have to work for a couple more years till I can take my cash balance retirement and walk. Then we plan to run the farm full time. For us the key is trying to NOT have to get the bank loan or to minimize it. We have a reasonable business plan, good credit, and a market. But I still don't like the risk. So we will get ourselves well positioned before we make the loan leap. That would be to buy more acreage and put in a bunch of greenhouses and Hops trellises. \n\nAt like a decade and half older than you I am worried it is a little late to start a new career path, but fuck it. \n\nHere is the bottom line: Decide what is maximum level of security you are willing to give up NOW for the family now to have something maybe better LATER. I would say some combination of things might be in order:\n\nFirst: if you are working don't quit the day job. Look into local community/junior college ag programs. See if they have \"certificates\" for stuff that they offer while working toward a degree. Get a certificate a few classes at a time. \n\nSecond get with the state extension service office. See what free classes and programs they have. Learn as much as you can. Get out and meet people in ag. This will help you with knowledge and to maybe meet someone who can help you with the next phase. \n\nThird: Get a part time job. Find a landscaper. Offer to help on nights and weekends or when you have time. maybe just a day or two a week or pick up slack during busy times. OR find a farmer that needs help at planting time or harvest time. maybe the local dairy goat farm needs someone to help pull new fence or spring clean out a deep littered barn. You get experience and start to get ideas about what you really want to do. \n\nForth: make the leap. Two years in you have a basic horticulture or agriculture production certificate form the college, you knwo a bunch of guys, and one of them needs someone to work or lead a work crew. You jump from the day job to landscaping or staff at the green house. \n\nNow you are working in the industry. Keep working and learning. Keep taking the college classes. Now you can finnish out the business classes and math. Get that degree. \n\nLast phase is now you have several years experience in the business working for someone, you have a AAS, start your own place or buy into one. I see several businesses and farms that sell or get bought out every year. Growers want to retire. Someone get s sick and can't herd dairy goats anymore, or whatever. Maybe instead of a full cold start you buy into a turnkey operation. \n\n\nIt is doable. Just take it in little bites. ",

                "content": "31 + 2 years for an associates degree seems risky when the end goal is to own your own landscaping or other related agriculture business, and you already have some student debt.\n\nHow old are your kids, in 3-5 years would 1 or more be able to help you run a lawn mower or a leaf blower, etc?\n\nI think your time would be better spent working for a landscape crew or on the grounds crew for a golf course. Do that for 2-3 years and make money, rather than more debt for the associates, and learn on the job. So about the same amount of time, gaining knowledge, hit up the local library for as many horticultural books as you can and be paid for your time.\n\nIf you have cash to pay for the associates degree that\u2019s great! Leave that money in a money market account, (low return but zero risk for 2-3 years), and use that to purchase equipment when the time comes.\n\nI am 35, and am about to start farming myself. If I were in your shoes, I would start with the golf courses and ask to speak with the head grounds keeper, tell them your Elevator Pitch of a 2-3 year goal to start your own XYZ business and that you are a sponge eager to learn all that you can, and ask for a job that would allow you to learn AND in 6-12 months be responsible for managing a small crew or fully responsible for some aspect of the work. Yes, ask for management opportunities, and you may add that you would do it without increased pay. \n\nSo much of owning your own business is managing all the small details. \n\nI have worked fir one golf course and knowing the guys there, I think the head grounds guy would have gone for this. A lot of the employees were college or high school students. Having a 25-35 year old come in, wanting to learn, and could help heard the cats would probably have been a great deal for him.\n\nBasically your asking for an apprenticeship. Willing to work for less pay, with the expectation that you will be actively educated, and ultimately get more responsibility than a \u201cnormal\u201d employe would, in a shorter amount of time, because both you and the \u201cboss\u201d, know it\u2019s for a specific amount of time.\n\nGolf courses also have the advantage of working with golfers who will appreciate your work, and could become your landscape/yard maintenance clients.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t any golf courses in your area, I would research every landscape company and garden/nursery/greenhouse in your region. Like deep research, try and know all the competition and each companies history, services provided, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and their internal narrative as you can before you go and talk with anyone.  \n\nThis serves multiple purposes. First and foremost all of these companies will either be your competition, your vendors, or depending on what route you take they could be your customers. \n\nThis also gives you the opportunity to learn who among this group may have the heart of a teacher and be willing to take on an apprentice who may go on to start a company that would compete with them. However when you sit down to talk with them about your apprenticeship idea and your goal of owning your own company in 2-3 years you can communicate how you know who all the regional players are and that your intention is not to compete against who ever trains you, but to further help them stomp out all the other completion. \n\nIt\u2019s been my experience in agricultural and manufacturing circles that the honorable companies and individuals are always willing to help people and competitors out in nearly anyway they can. They know business is difficult and that they were helped along the way. They also know that they don\u2019t want to be successful at what they do by poisoning the well for others. They want to be the best because they are the best. \n\nIn both of the examples above, golf course or commercial apprenticeship, you will be showing the leadership necessary to own your own business in the future. People may tell you no, and wish you luck, but you will have made a positive impression, and will have begun the process of professionally networking within the sector you want to work in. Maybe your plans change and you don\u2019t own your own business but 2-3 years from now your not finishing your degree and looking to start, but are instead taking over more responsibility with your current employer when the apprenticeship ends. Or you are afforded the opportunity to purchase your mentors landscape company, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI think these options give you more opportunities than the associates degree would in the long term.\n\nBlessings and good luck. \n\n\n\n\n",

If it's actual farming, try getting a community plot, or volunteering at a small farm operation to see what it's really like.  Best of luck!",

Silvicultue might be a good fit (includes tree planting, stand exams, writing prescriptions for a stand to meet future desires). There is also ecological or dealing with invasive plants,  along with other niche jobs.\n\nB. There is very little machinery involved in most forestry jobs unless you decide to get a job as a logger. Depending on how adverse you are to heavy machines you might avoid jobs in sale administration,  as there you need to be around the machinery at least enough to know that the loggers are following the contract. (I'm a logging systems specialist and even I am rairly around active sites, its mostly planning).\n\nC. In my experience there is no difficulty in getting a job as a female.  And actually for my employer slightly over half of the foresters (with a 4 year degree) are female. There are a lot more males in the tech series which is those with no degree or a 2 year degree. (I work for the federal government, and had a few internships with private companies during school)\n\nD. Basic ppe is just boots, a vest, and appropriate clothes for your location. But most employers provide a vest and a lot provide money for you to buy boots with.",

Wilderness trail building often precludes the use of power tool. Axes, shovels, and a misery whip (well named). Tree planting with a shovel or dibble. Forest inventory with a d-tape. GIS in an air conditioned office.\n\nC) Both are still male dominated industries, women are likely to meet resistance. It is better than it has been in the past. Insist that it is better for you, and call idiots on their bullshit.\n\n Competence helps. Some positions do require physical strength and stamina. The Arduous Pack Test portion of getting a woodland fire fighting related gig does not discriminate as to gender. 3 miles, 45 minutes, 45 pounds. You can either meet that standard and get a Red Card or not. Most positions will document the physical requirements objectively. Moderate Field Test is 2 miles, 25 pounds, 30 minutes. Light Walk 1 miles, 16 minutes, no pack.\n\nD) PPE required for the job - should be supplied by your employer. I have my own preferences for sun, eye, and hearing protection, but wear both, on and off the job. Boots that fit - job may require toe protection. Composite over steel for me.\n\nIf you love what you do, you will find a way. Embrace the power tools of the trade. Versions are available in lighter weights appropriate to smaller frames. They can be used safely with training and PPE. Erasing a particular invasive, (YST, I'm talking about you)  with a string trimmer is remarkably rewarding. \n\nGood luck.",

Until very recently I worked as a resident advisor for several years which restricted my schedule considerably during the school year. I wish I had a good excuse for summer - but at the end of the day I don't exactly have anything relevant to forestry.\n\nForestry is something I've seen a few times in my education and something I've started to learn more about in some of my final classes, and it's something I'm considering for when I graduate. The problem falls back to my resume. I live in North Carolina and while jobs are out there I get the impression that I am at best under-qualified. \n\nTo start, is my major something I could even feasibly pivot into forestry? Is forestry something I could get into fresh out of undergrad or would I need to start considering going for my master's, or even a certificate? I'm also considering AmeriCorp and ACE either for the rest of my senior year or possibly after I graduate. \n\nAny advice here? COVID has honestly thrown me for a loop and given me a tough reality check. I want to find good work once I graduate but I'm worried that I spent my undergrad setting myself up for failure.",

And like you, my eyes were opened to forestry as my undergrad was winding down. I ended up adding a minor in Forest Management before I left because the field was so gravitating to me. \n\nI'm now 9 years out of undergrad and work for an NGO as \"Forests Program Manager\". My job is to create and run programs around forests, which includes a lot of reforestation and helping private forest landowners to manage their woods. Basically a Service Forester, but not for a government agency and with a lot more freedom and a lot less red tape.\n\nAnd I've got good news: many of my colleagues are also Fisheries/Wildlife grads who found their way to forestry over time. It will definitely take a while for you to get there though; work experience is everything. But that's the same for a wildlife job, and it's very much worth it for either!\n\nIf you're interested in production forestry (sales, timbering, mill operations, etc), I can't really speak to what could help get you there. But I can provide advice for how you could be professionally involved in forest management like I am.\n\nSomething that would be very helpful would be getting experience in vegetation management. You may be able to volunteer to control invasive plants at a local park, for example. And/or volunteer with a local NGO to plant trees (fall planting season is coming up!). Things like that will help you get seasonal/technician jobs which will eventually lead to full-time positions. Grad school is also really important (but not absolutely necessary) for these kinds of jobs, but going after you've done some tech jobs and seen how things work in the real world can make grad school a better, more focused experience. And you can for sure give it a shot, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a state job, or even more so a fed job. That doesn't have to do with your level of experience; they're just really hard to get.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you'd like!",

ACE is known for coming into areas there are already programs and setting up shop, potentially stealing partners. I've also talked to several alumni who felt there was inadequate training, and people being shoved into leadership without experience, support, or structure.",

Wildlifers that went straight to grad school fared a little better out of school but not by too much. \n\nThere are just so many more wildlife degreed folks compared the amount of Wildlife job opportunities. At Warnell, it was fueled mostly by the fact that the school has somewhat of a perverse incentive to care more about total school (aka dept) student enrollment rather than student outcome. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to, I\u2019d try to do a double major. I think in Warnell it\u2019s only an extra semester. I just know that foresters have a much better initial career outcomes in terms of salary and ease of job placement. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that I don\u2019t think wildlife folks don\u2019t an important job, but it\u2019s an even more narrow field than forestry.

The reason being obviously is that my forest management decisions are directly affecting their habitat. Going the forestry route does not mean you have to be done with wildlife.\n\nUltimately, it's not just the degree.

        "content": "How to land a forestry job outside of the US, as a US citizen\nJust wondering if anyone has any experience working internationally and could share some tips on how to go about finding these jobs. I've heard great things about the forestry industries in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and a few more. A little background on me: I'm a rising senior in college and working towards a BS in wildlife conservation and forestry. During summer breaks I've worked for the US Forest Service as a forestry technician and for my university's forestry research program. My tentative plan is to try and join a fire crew after graduation and do that for maybe a year max, save up some money, then move.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips that could help me to improve my odds of getting an international job? Is it mostly based off of experience or connections? Do I need to get a masters degree? Is there a particular country that is easier to find jobs than others? Is it even possible? Thanks!",

        "content": "Forestry does not drive deforestation. Here's what the science says\nHabitat loss and deforestation are terrible issues that capture media attention. The forestry industry is often blamed for environmental destruction, but the science does not back these claims. I'm tired of seeing the finger pointed at the forestry industry while other industries walk away guilt-free. Here's a good research article that explains this point. \n\n[Classifying drivers of global forest loss.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1108) Curtis et al. 2018\n\nThis study documented the global causes of deforestation and breaks it down by region and cause. Prior studies erroneously indicated that forestry was a large cause of deforestation, but Curtis et al. (2018) makes the distinction between permanent forest conversion and temporary loss of forest cover. **Deforestation** is the result of a land-use transition from a forested ecosystem to non-forested one with no regrowth. Forest cover loss is often confused with deforestation, but the difference here is regrowth. If a clear-cut or wildfire removes forest cover, it is not deforestation if the forest is regenerated over time. On the other hand, agriculture conversion of forest to cattle pasture is deforestation because regrowth does not occur, it is permanently altered. \n\nNow to the results of the study. Forestry represented 26% of forest disturbance globally. That may sound disturbing, but **all forestry had forest regrowth**. Wildfires caused 23% of forest disturbance, but that too was characterized with forest regrowth in subsequent years. 27% of land was deforested through commodity driven deforestation. They did not define what specific commodities drove deforestation, but agriculture operations for palm oil and cattle production have been indicated as main causes in [other](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab0d41) [studies](https://www.wri.org/publication/estimating-role-seven-commodities-agriculture-linked-deforestation?downloaded=true). \n\nThis study clearly demonstrates that forestry is not a driver of deforestation, but sadly this won't keep people from stating otherwise. Active management of forests through harvest can even be good for wildlife. [This study](https://www.intechopen.com/books/new-perspectives-in-forest-science/relationship-between-bird-diversity-and-habitat-along-a-pine-oak-successional-forest-in-southern-mex) found that bird diversity was highest in early and mid successional forests, while being lowest in mature forests. This means that sustainable logging *increases* wildlife diversity by opening the forest canopy. Now this isn't to say that forestry is totally innocent, it can cause problems if poorly planned or if a plantation transforms natural habitat. However, it's far more sustainable than other agriculture operations and actually sequesters carbon which reduces global warming.",

Sure, there are some good apples that sustainably manage their forests, but overall, the majority of forests in the US are owned by a few large corporations that have turned to real estate investment trusts and are funded by Wall Street. So now in my state there are logging projects all over, funded by Wall Street trying to get a return on their investments. It\u2019s resulted in unsustainable logging that is widespread across the landscape. It\u2019s causing the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet to go extinct and many animals have been removed from the landscape. \n\nThis type of management has also turned our forests into carbon sources in many places, and in my state, the timber industry is the number 1 emitter. An industrial thinning project releases as much carbon as a severe wildfire of the same size.\n\nWhen I think of forestry in my state, I think of our forest service, BLM, and big timber chainsaws destroying our forests. As a field checked of timber sales, I see first hand the native national forests that they log. The streams they destroy. The biodiversity the erase. It\u2019s brutal, and pains me to see as a soil and water scientist. \n\n\nSo yeah I where you are coming from and what you are saying. Yes we should highlight the people doing things well in forestry, but we really need to shine a light on the horrible practices the industry employs. Turning old growth forests into industrial timber farms is not great. And that is everywhere around me. An ecological nightmare caused by the industry.",

I've done it, I'm real good at it, but what I was laying out, (steep conventional/winch-assist), just will be doing too much damage to the forest. Shallow soils, poor nutrient regime, high precipitation areas.... you can see from previous logging in the 80's in the area that it's turning from Spruce/Subalipne Fir dominated to nearly entirely dominated by shrub species, (unsuccessful replanting).\nYes. That is the course of nature to a degree. But a heavy amount of human interference has lead to it becoming such a thing! There are caribou, moose, bears, and migratory bird species, (all seen in these blocks), and sensitve soils, but no fucks were given.\n\nI don't want to be involved with poor practices. I want to help people understand sustainable practices and living. But I love being in the field.....I might be asking too much. It might simply be work for a conservation industry",

Do you have repeat jobs for private land owners? How feasible is it for a private land owner to harvest trees twice a year? And how many logs would normally be cut in a day?\n2. On an average logging operation, how many people are on the team and what is the hierarchy, if any?\n3.

If a fatal accident happens on site, what happens legally and in regards to insurance, and who is  responsible - the individual or the owner?\n5.

Is the process of loading always done at the end of the day or the end of the job?",

ArcCollector is gps based and has a visual component and Survey123 is form based and easy to stand up - getting usable data back is the hardest part.",

Especially the TIMO\u2019s that don\u2019t even has field foresters (Hancock does) and just farm our most of the real forestry work to underpaid consultants. \n\nTIMO\u2019s might provide solid continuous cash flow, but I seriously think these companies have overstated the possible returns. Heck, look at the California Teacher pension fund disaster in East Texas. \n\nTIMO\u2019s and REIT\u2019s make most of their money via land sales to private individuals. They systematically disintegrate the landbase that has been built in the last 120 years. \n\nI think it is a little disingenuous to look at the decline of local control of Oregon timberland and companies in a vacuum. There are tons of factors at play. The change in taxation law, the spotted owl rollout, softwood lumber trade with Canada, Canadian beetle infestation and subsequent domination of the American sawmilling industry. The spotted owl event had tons of unintended consequences and I think this is probably the biggest manifestation of it. \n\nIn the short term, I think the forest products manufacturing industry will continue to contract and consolidate. The TIMO\u2019s and REIT\u2019s will sell of their land to meet cash flow requirements until there isn\u2019t anything left to sell. The manufacturing companies that make it through will either have to hire a bunch of procurement foresters to handle all the small landowner contacts or will decide to start buying land again. The current business mode cannot go on forever.",

        "content": "I have an idea for a commercial ebony farm in Western Oklahoma\nI'm posting this here because I would like to get the opinion of some people who have been in the business. Who knows, maybe someone will be able to get a higher-up in their company to look into this idea.\n\nFirst off, a little background information:\n\nAfrican Blackwood, (*Dalbergia melanoxylon*) also known as the \"original ebony,\" is prized for it's hardness, sound properties, and especially it's beautiful jet-black color. Unfortunately, this tree is suffering from a huge problem: sustainability. These trees take about 70-100 years before they reach harvesting age, and as demand for this wood increases worldwide, mostly from the instrument industry, global tree count is dwindling. This is in part due to illegal logging, with a primary focus on making a quick profit, rather than harvesting these trees in an economically sustainable fashion. Also, political instability, combined with weak governments means that African countries are having a very difficult time preventing illicit harvest of this tree.\n\nI've done my research, and I believe that this would be a good idea. My plan would be for a timber company purchase 1,400 acres in Western Oklahoma (although I have recently come to the conclusion that Western Texas may be better). This area is ideal, because it is one of the few areas in the United States with large areas of land that meet the growing requirements for this tree. This area would have to be watched and maintained regularly to prevent timber poaching.\n\nThis area would be divided into 14 lots of 100 acres each. Each lot would be capable of holding 2,400 trees, with the whole farm having a capacity of about 33,600 trees. Every 5 years, another one of the lots would be planted. By the time the last lot has been planted, the first lot would be harvested. Based on my calculations, after the first trees have attained harvesting age, this farm would be extremely profitable. Assuming ebony prices stay the same, is that any given lot would be worth around $24,000,000 when harvested. This is a conservative estimate, assuming a low of $10,000 per tree. Assuming regular 5 year intervals between harvests, and assuming the wood is stored and sold over time rather than all at once, the farm would be capable of generating $4,800,000 *every year*.\n\nWhile I don't have any solid numbers for what it would cost to start this farm, my estimate would be anywhere from 4 - 6 million dollars, with the biggest expense being the cost of the land. There would also be a cost for the periodic planting of these trees, which I don't really have any numbers for at the moment. Assuming a total cost of $8 million, this farm would pay for itself within *2 years* after the initial 70-year growing period.\n\nAs global tree count dwindles, and experts predict commercial extinction or this tree within a short period of time, this farm could secure a domestic supply of ebony. It would allow industrial production to take place in a relatively stable and safe country, in a commercially sustainable fashion. This would make it easier to purchase and sell ebony products, as one wouldn't need to go through the customs problems of importing a threatened wood. As an added bonus, it would also help to alleviate the problem of illegal forestry in Africa.",

You're focused on potential dollar revenue when you haven't considered how valuable the wood really is. If it's going extinct... does anyone care enough with their money to pay a premium for it when they can use another wood with similar physical characteristic (and can be stained to a similar color)? What investors want to wrap up 8million for 70years on a conservative investment (all timber) when the unknowns will continue to show themselves for... 70yrs. \n\nI do know of some oddball specialty lumber species if you're interested in short rotation, hardwood.

        "content": "Wages in Oregon's Forest Industry\nI might have the opportunity in the next moth to meet with my legislators (I'm in Oregon) and discuss issues surrounding forestry. As a younger person starting my career, the issue of low wages in the forestry sector is something that concerns me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2016 I attended the OSAF convention in Tigard, where a representative from the Associated Oregon Loggers gave a speech lamenting how he couldn't afford to pay his crew a fair wage anymore. The year after I started thinking about the issue more when I noticed that unskilled labor positions were paying the same or more than an entry level timber cruiser (Amazon warehouse at $15/hr, Panda Express Assistant managers making $17.60/hr, doggy-daycare attendants at $16.50/hr). Considering most entry level timber jobs require an associates degree and prior experience in natural resources, it is troubling that they are valued less than unskilled labor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorking as a full time forester often means living in a rural area, where renting may not be an option. [The average salary for a forester in Oregon is $61,220-$65,790 as of 2017](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191032.htm), while a quick Google search shows that average the salary needed for home ownership in Oregon is [$87,160 per year](https://howmuch.net/articles/salary-to-afford-the-average-home-in-your-state). In a state known for its forests, foresters can't even afford homes. Many of the people I work with joke that they are \"house poor.\" They get paid enough to maybe afford a bit of property, but they spend a crazily disproportionate amount of their income on their mortgage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bar to becoming a good forester is relatively high. Knowledge regarding silviculture, GIS, log marketing and cruising is needed, in addition to being able to navigate the state's forest practices laws. Education, licenses and certifications (herbicide applicator, SAF certified forester, GIS training), continuing education and professional development are all time consuming and cost money. On top of this, there's the issue of inconsistent seasonal work for the first few years of a forestry career. Unless you get lucky you might spend 2-4 years waiting to get 1-2 years experience. For the amount of effort needed to become an expert and land a permanent job the returns are small. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is little incentive (other than having a love for the job) for talented individuals to enter the industry, at least in this state. At a time when the general public is frustrated with the quality of forest management on both private and public lands, we must give talented and creative people an incentive to start a career in forestry if we want a workforce capable of solving the problems surrounding forest management. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo given this, I'd like your thoughts. Are foresters and forestry techs in Oregon paid fairly? What could be done to increase wages? Is my analysis totally off? I welcome whatever input you might have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Foresters in Oregon don't make much money proportionate to the training required for the job. How can that be fixed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

In California employers can't find qualified foresters because of licensing requirements and a major age gap that the baby boomers are leaving. Wages in California are still typically in the 60-75k range, but with the wildfires that have been hammering the west I think the demand for qualified professionals to manage that risk is going to increase dramatically.  It'll be interesting to see how the industry reacts, given the already ridiculously high cost to prepare timber sales in the state. ",

Guidance greatly appreciated!\nHello Forestry, I hope everyone is doing today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the title says, most of the work experience I've had after uni has been teaching, namely as an English teacher in foreign countries. However I recently decided that this isn't the career that I want to pursue. I'm from rural America and have always been an outdoors-y person and have considered a career such as park ranger or working for a park. Doing some research lately has led me to discover that an education in forestry affords many career paths other than park or logging industry work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeally, I'd love a job that allows me to work inside AND outside and can help feed a family if my future has such needs. I feel like either helping to foster an environment (wildfire, conservation, habitat etc.), park management, or even urban forestry would be satisfying career paths. Anything that encourages environmental growth or helping people enjoy the outdoors would make me a happy man. I do not think, however, that industry work is for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, my undergrad was more political science based and I don't even know how to approach steering my life in this direction. When I head back home should I ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Try to get a grunt-work job? If so, what grunt-work jobs would give me experience to climb into these areas of work I mentioned? A quick look through indeed.com seems to show even most entry level gigs need an undergrad in a related field.\n\n\\-Take the GRE and get a masters while trying to get experience during internships and part-time gigs? If so, what programs should I look at? How do I go about finding an adviser that suits me? What would getting a master degree without years of experience do for getting jobs? I don't mind school. Heck, I kinda like it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think you can imagine how much I would appreciate any advice. I really wouldn't mind either of these options as long as I knew it would be the best for my future. I'm not old yet but I ain't getting younger and I'm moving back stateside this summer without a concrete plan in mind. Needless to say, I'm a bit shook! \\^\\_\\^\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll try to reply as fast as possible but there is most likely a large time difference I have to work around! Any advice is appreciated.

                "content": "Well, as much as I always try to steer people into the profession, I don't think becoming a forester is the right move for you, given your post. I just want to make it clear that park ranger =/= forester. Forestry is the art and science of managing forested landscapes to meet objectives defined by society and landowners. Typical activities a forester would do include forest inventory (analyzing density of vegetation, species composition, estimating standing volume and growth of timber or carbon stores, forest canopy density, etc.), making silvicultural prescriptions (modifying stand composition to meet pre-defined objectives, also known as applied forest ecology. This includes tree planting prescriptions), fuels management (identifying quantity and type of fuels located on a parcel, and making recommendations to modify wildland fire characteristics), timber appraisal and forest economics, forest road construction and planning, and forest health assessments (identifying various forest pests and pathogens that impact forests). It's possible to learn these skills without a degree, by working directly under another forester, but it will take a considerable amount of time and forestry isn't exactly a high paying sector of the economy.\n\nIf you'd like to work for the parks as a park ranger, it seems like you have a skill set that could translate well into the natural resource interpretation field, given your teaching background. You may want to take courses in environmental science, and environmental planning and interpretation. These fields translate well into teaching the general public about the environment.\n\n",

I am like you OP, no interest in Industry, although I didn't realize that until I was well into my degree. I am just about done, and am interested in all sorts of tangential areas of forestry - but have pretty much zero interest in being a \"forester\" in the traditional sense. \n\nAlthough my forestry degree has great breadth to it, the core classes are of limited interest to me and it's kind of a drag. Sometimes I wish I took an environmental science/conservation type degree. That said, the RPF is desirable, and I am still applicable for the same jobs the environmental science types can get, but they can't get the forestry jobs which are also available to me. \n\nI've got 2 courses left following this semester. After, i've decided on 2 options: (1) Urban Forestry, and (2) Environmental/forestry consulting and then pivoting into government land-use planning (or something similar). I dilly dally around whether I want to get a Masters or not; returning to school has had tremendous cost and opportunity cost, and I am burnt out. That said, I am excited by the opportunity as well. Right now I just want to return to normal working life for a bit. \n\nFYI - I returned to school at your age. ",

It's not as easy to get your foot in the door but it's possible. \n\nHonestly my best advice based on your other comments would be to get your GRE scores and find an assistant-ship (paid for) masters. Then you won't have to waste time getting another undergraduate or associate's degree and will be able to fill in information gaps with undergraduate classes at the same time. You could live off of a combination grants, instructing lower-level classes, and savings (if you have any). Doing this now makes sense since presumably you don't yet have a family to take care of. Finding someone who is willing to be your advisor is tricky but again, it can be done; my mentor in university pulled a 29 year old computer programmer out of the private sector to do a master's thesis on mountain forest ecology. Look on the jobs boards in the sidebar right now (the Texas A&M one and the Forestry USA one are both good for this sort of thing) to see what assistant-ships are available. You can also try contacting professors through professional networking events or on social media (I know a handful of forestry scientists active on twitter).\n\nOnce you have your masters  you would be well-qualified for all the entry-level work in traditional forestry and potentially be able to \"skip\" a rung or two on the career ladder. If you want to work for the feds, you'll still need to come from the bottom or close to due to their tendency to hire internally for higher level positions. You would also be pretty employable by certain environmental consulting firms/non-profits. \n\nGood luck, man! When I decided to stop pursuing a career as an architect and went into forestry, I was pretty uncertain about forestry but it ended up being one of the best decisions of my life.",

Across the 1.8 million acres in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, they are restoring thousands of acres to functioning shortleaf pine-bluestem ecosystems with clusters of red cockaded woodpeckers through commercial timber harvests, a huge prescribed fire program, pre-commercial thins, timber stand improvement treatments, using even and uneven aged silviculture systems. \n\nThat *is* \u201creal active forest management\u201d. \n\n",

I am relocating almost 2000 miles to a southern state for either position I accept. These are the two positions I have been offered: \n\n- The arborist position would be for a large private employee-owned company with multiple locations throughout the US. I have never been a very avid tree climber, but this position would allow me to work on my climbing skills in order to trim/treat trees. I was told when offered the position that they would try and move me up in the company quickly, paying for my ISA certification, and they told me that I could move into tree research or sales as I progressed in the company. They would be paying me $2000 more annually when compared to the other position and are offering to help with relocation. \n\n- The fire mitigation position is an assistant crew lead position for a government-funded public safety organization. I like that I would be supervising a group of 5-6 people, and I think I would also have room to move up into a crew lead position after working for several years. I also think I got lucky to be offered the job as I have not worked on fire very often (though I am a certified wild land firefighter, my work has been more on-call). The pay is still good despite being less than the arborist position, but no talk of help with relocation so far. Despite this, I am not desperate for help with relocation, and would prefer to be in a position in which the work makes me feel most fulfilled.\n\n\nBoth sound awesome and fulfilling to me and I am struggling to decide which one I should accept.

Depending on your local ISA chapter they might not recognise your forestry degree as being relevant to the field (happened to a friend of mine in Ontario). You're also likely to spend your first year in arboriculture dragging brush to a chipper with almost no climbing. You'll get to handle the ropes on the ground which is probably the highlight of that job but overall it's extremely repetitive and downright mind numbing with short bursts of 'holy fuck there's no way this is going to work/I think I might be about to die.' Climbing is a bit of a different story. Less boring but more 'shit shit shit' moments, the pay caps out pretty fast unless you start working for a municipality or utility company, and it's the second most dangerous job on land after logging. You should also be ok with a chainsaw spinning a few inches from your face. That being said, some people absolutely love it and wouldn't trade it for anything but it definitely takes a certain kind of personality. Most climbing arborists I've met are at least half crazy and many are full on nuts. Most guys also don't last more than 10 years due to strain injuries, but that's less of an issue now with newer climbing systems. If you decide to go the arb route, all I can say is safety has to be priority number one at all times. Always wear your PPE, even when it sucks. Double up on hearing protection when operating the chipper unless you want serious hearing loss in a short period of time. If your boss starts cutting corners on safety, GTFO. My boss just ordered up a bunch of portawraps to be made by his buddy Frankie. No fucking thank you. The production standards on those things are written in other people's blood. I quit yesterday cause I'm not using home cooked rigging devices. And cherry on top, he also told me that he was trying to buy used rope for the crews to save a few bucks which is something you abso-fucking-lutely do not do. It wasn't even rope rated for use in arboriculture to begin with. Anyways, anyone got any leads on a job in southern Ontario?",

I then received an email 1/10 that said would be receiving a phone call between 1/13-17 if I had been selected for the position. IF I wasn\u2019t selected I was to receive an email of rejection by today (1/23). \n\nI haven\u2019t received a call or email yet, and I know I\u2019m still technically within the timeframe but I am obviously super excited for the potential opportunity. I have already come to terms that if I was selected I probably would\u2019ve heard back already. \n\nIs this normal for the process to be slow? Has anyone else heard back yet? I suppose I am just looking for more insight. Thank you!!\n\nUPDATE: Duty station is in Glide, OR (region 6)",

What are the trade offs when converting a pine plantation to something more diverse?\n2. What are the best approaches to making the transition?\n\nThis land has been pine for, gosh, at least 50 years. More than two clear cut harvests. Recently went through replanting and discussed with the consulting forester and the local government forester. They were both against doing anything other than standard pine planting. The soil report indicates that it's not good for anything except pine, but I suspect that is just because it has only been pine for so long that it would need some time to build up healthy soil again. There are also the issues of herbicides and sprays and things.\n\nMy guess is that, once it is clear cut, you just have to let it do it's thing for a while, but that is going to make it very difficult to cultivate anything specific, and it seems like there would be better options in terms of carbon sequestration, and food sources for animals and possibly people (e.g. chestnuts, etc.). The outcome doesn't necessarily need to be timber ...\n\n3. Has anyone done this before?\n\n4. What were the goals and results?\n\n5. How did you do it?\n\n6. How long did it take?\n\nThe land in in the southeast USA (zone 7b).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Thanks for all the info y'all. Enjoy the woods!",

A good forester could explain the site-specific requirements (chance of a natural seed bank in soil, blow in, need for planting). Planting many hardwoods like oaks could have very long pay back periods (outside a human lifetime). Look into natural pine forests if that\u2019s an option where you are. Shortleaf and longleaf forest types are in short supply compared to even recent natural history and they offer surprisingly high levels of unique diversity. \n\nThe local foresters may be encouraging planted pine production because it\u2019s harder to reestablish planted pine land in your area, the markets for pine are exceptional there, plantation management is best for controlling invasive species or pests, or as one dimensional as the higher personal revenue (commission on sale, local tax revenue from timber sale). The latter is unlikely from a state forester, and he/she should be more helpful once you establish your objectives and budget. \n\nTry your local university\u2019s cooperative forestry extension service (land grant / ag schools). The Southeast has some of the best public university extension services in the world and they often love hearing from landowners as interested as you. Best of luck.",

The consultant should be able to think outside the box and work for you. \n\nOne option is planting other varieties of pines (rather than loblolly) shortleaf and longleaf pines are both longer lived pines that compete well and can support diverse habitats and historically covered more ground then they do now.\n\nAnother option is to start with pines but interplant hardwoods of various species. so replant every third row with some sort of hardwood (oak would probably be best). When you begin cutting make sure you select the pines and then move to the hardwoods.\n\nI live in the midwest so pine doesn't compete the best but can do ok with time. We planted 2/3 pine, 1/3 hardwoods (walnut and red oak usually) whenever we thin we select pines to cut first but we always try to leave 5 pines per acre as remnant (keeping the best most dominant). This can extend the rotation and increases the future value of the hardwoods by reducing the lower stem sprouts.\n\nDon't clear cut unless you have regeneration that can compete with the brush that is released following a cut. if you cut now without regeneration or replanting you may just brush back for decades or more or even worse just invasive.\n\nCan you share what type of soil it is clay, loam, sand etc? If you can pay taxes on the land and keep up with the maintenance you should be able to plant some hardwoods.",

The forestry industry is often blamed for environmental destruction, but the science does not back these claims. I'm tired of seeing the finger pointed at the forestry industry while other industries walk away guilt-free. Here's a good research article that explains this point. \n\n[Classifying drivers of global forest loss.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1108) Curtis et al. 2018\n\nThis study documented the global causes of deforestation and breaks it down by region and cause. Prior studies erroneously indicated that forestry was a large cause of deforestation, but Curtis et al. (2018) makes the distinction between permanent forest conversion and temporary loss of forest cover. **Deforestation** is the result of a land-use transition from a forested ecosystem to non-forested one with no regrowth. Forest cover loss is often confused with deforestation, but the difference here is regrowth. If a clear-cut or wildfire removes forest cover, it is not deforestation if the forest is regenerated over time. On the other hand, agriculture conversion of forest to cattle pasture is deforestation because regrowth does not occur, it is permanently altered. \n\nNow to the results of the study. Forestry represented 26% of forest disturbance globally. That may sound disturbing, but **all forestry had forest regrowth**. Wildfires caused 23% of forest disturbance, but that too was characterized with forest regrowth in subsequent years. 27% of land was deforested through commodity driven deforestation. They did not define what specific commodities drove deforestation, but agriculture operations for palm oil and cattle production have been indicated as main causes in [other](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab0d41) [studies](https://www.wri.org/publication/estimating-role-seven-commodities-agriculture-linked-deforestation?downloaded=true). \n\nThis study clearly demonstrates that forestry is not a driver of deforestation, but sadly this won't keep people from stating otherwise. Active management of forests through harvest can even be good for wildlife. [This study](https://www.intechopen.com/books/new-perspectives-in-forest-science/relationship-between-bird-diversity-and-habitat-along-a-pine-oak-successional-forest-in-southern-mex) found that bird diversity was highest in early and mid successional forests, while being lowest in mature forests. This means that sustainable logging *increases* wildlife diversity by opening the forest canopy. Now this isn't to say that forestry is totally innocent, it can cause problems if poorly planned or if a plantation transforms natural habitat. However, it's far more sustainable than other agriculture operations and actually sequesters carbon which reduces global warming.",

Sure, there are some good apples that sustainably manage their forests, but overall, the majority of forests in the US are owned by a few large corporations that have turned to real estate investment trusts and are funded by Wall Street. So now in my state there are logging projects all over, funded by Wall Street trying to get a return on their investments. It\u2019s resulted in unsustainable logging that is widespread across the landscape. It\u2019s causing the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet to go extinct and many animals have been removed from the landscape. \n\nThis type of management has also turned our forests into carbon sources in many places, and in my state, the timber industry is the number 1 emitter. An industrial thinning project releases as much carbon as a severe wildfire of the same size.\n\nWhen I think of forestry in my state, I think of our forest service, BLM, and big timber chainsaws destroying our forests. As a field checked of timber sales, I see first hand the native national forests that they log. The streams they destroy. The biodiversity the erase. It\u2019s brutal, and pains me to see as a soil and water scientist. \n\n\nSo yeah I where you are coming from and what you are saying. Yes we should highlight the people doing things well in forestry, but we really need to shine a light on the horrible practices the industry employs. Turning old growth forests into industrial timber farms is not great. And that is everywhere around me. An ecological nightmare caused by the industry.",

Accept my apologies if this is the wrong forum for this post.\n\nPlease, please, please:  if you are going fishing, please know the fish in your fisheries and also how to handle them!  Fish are delicate creatures and require proper handling --both for their safety and yours.  Fishing is much more than just being able to throw out a line and get a bite; it's equally as important to handle the fish in a manner that gives it the greatest chance for survival once released*.\n\nToday I was fishing a local forest preserve, in a pool that I know is home to Muskie and Pike, as well as catfish and largemouth bass.  After bringing in a nice looking bass, I switched up lures to a deep diving crankbait.  On the very first cast, I noticed a Muskie follow it right up from the bottom to the surface, just a handful of inches away as I pulled my lure out.  (There was an obstruction beside me, I couldn't work the lure any longer.)  I repeated this three more times until I decided, hey, I don't have a net, proper pliers or a landing mat, I should leave this guy alone until I have the proper tools.  As much fun as it would be to hook a Musky, I decided I just didn't want those problems today while hunting for bass.\n\nSomeone else, however, decided differently.  This Musky and his buddy were cruising the shallows and could be seen from the waters edge.  They would cruise along by, go deep for awhile and then make another lap.  These two guys decided they wanted to catch one of them and began throwing crankbaits out for it.  Shortly, one of the Muskie obliged and took the lure.\n\nNow, please understand something:  this is not sour grapes.  I'm not upset because I didn't catch this Muskie and someone else did.  I'm not upset I didn't catch it.  I could have and didn't.  I figured to leave him for another day.  Most people around here only bass fish anyway.  What I am upset with is what followed the catch.\n\nThe guy who hooked up (A) attracted quite a crowd, including a guy (B) with a net.  Net guy managed to (finally) get the Muskie in the net and proceeded to walk him up the rocks to some concrete and lay the net and fish down, despite the pleading of myself and another (C).  After a few seconds I just picked the net up myself, while (C) reached in and properly took hold of the fish.  I then used my pliers to unhook the (foul hooked) fish.\n\nSo far, not horrible right?  But now, the guy who caught the fish comes up, wants to hold the fish and have his photo-op.  While waiting for the fish to get netted, he said he had never caught a Muskie or Pike before and didn't know how to get it out of the water.  I started saying \"WAIT WAIT WAIT!\" and tried to step in front of him but was too late --he stuck his hand out and put his fingers straight through the gills of this Musky!  He then took it from C and held it, fingers through the gills, vertical.  \"YOU HAVE YOUR FUCKING FINGERS THROUGH HIS GILLS!\"  I yelled.  Blank stare.  \n\nC and I took the fish back and tried to release him.  After about a minute in the water he swam a few inches and stopped, clearly looking in bad shape.\n\nAfter cooling off for 15 minutes or so, I found the guy who caught him, explained what happened and tried to explain the proper way to hold this fish.  I explained that he jammed his fingers into his gills and that this fish wasn't going to live because of this.  \n\n\"Oh,\" he said, turned away from me and went back to casting.\n\nI know this was long and probably not well written but like I said I'm pretty hot under the collar.  Especially with his flippant response.  Please remember while fishing that fish are living creatures and are often delicate.  They may not be able to think like you or I but they are still alive and deserve your respect and care.  So please, understand what species are in your fisheries and have at least a working understand of how to handle them so that they are not needlessly harmed while you are enjoying a summer pasttime.\n\nI'm going to get off my soapbox now and onto my motorcycle.

I'll be on a party boat (10 anglers total) on an all-depth day, meaning one halibut per person and limited ability to keep other species (I think...never offshore fished OR before, but that's how the regulations read to me). This is going to be my first party boat experience and my first halibut experience, so I'm not sure what to expect.\n\nHas anyone been on a party boat for halibut (or other species with such limited possession regulations)? With a limit of 1 halibut per person, I'm a little curious how it will all work, logistically. Once an angler catches their halibut, are they done fishing for the day, or is it more every-man-for-himself? (e.g., the boat limit is 10, so we fish until there are 10 halibut on board, even if the same angler catches all 10. So you gotta hope to get yours before the boat hits 10).\n\nI hope/assume the charter crew will go over all such rules when I get there, but I'm wondering if anyone has insights so I can go in with a bit more knowledge.\n\nAside from that, any general advice for party boats and/or halibut would be greatly appreciated.

We\u2019ve been to the Clackamas river, the Willamette River, Sandy River, and Hagg Lake. I\u2019ve caught two bass and one [trout](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0AzR2oKdp4vh7y2PWaYckmBWQ). My man? Zip. Zero. None. Period. We\u2019ve been trying to find areas where we have the highest chance of catching a fish and so far, all the areas are very packed, full of boats, tourists, just enjoying the lake and scaring any chance of catching a fish.\n\nLet me tell you. My man is frustrated. I\u2019m frustrated. The fish act like they\u2019re on a diet and I\u2019m loosing my patients. I keep telling myself, let\u2019s go back to Kansas and fish. And it\u2019s not like we can go on the water. Have you seen the price for renting a kayak, a boat or even BUYING a boat? I could buy a car and a trip to Jamaica with that money! We\u2019re newbies yes, but we are willing to learn about our new home. \n\nWe do have all fishing and a salmon/trout license. We have [these](https://www.mepps.com/species/chinook-king-salmon/42) type of lures. And trout seem to love them, their light weight, don\u2019t snag easily and look delicious to fish underwater (hence why I think these fish are on a diet).\n\nIf anyone is willing to give us advice on where to go, my man will finally stop snapping and breaking his poles (not anger, just frustration. He might start swingin\u2019 if we don\u2019t catch a fish soon. Heck, I might start doing the same). \n\nPlease, help us!",

Does anyone have knowledge of or can anyone recommend a commercial fishery (or sport charter area) in the southern half of the lower 49? I'm guessing a deckhand on a charter boat isn't going to make much money (at least that's the way it is here, tips only basically) but would at least be enjoyable work. Other non-processing fishing related jobs would be considered as well. Bonus points if it's in an area with a lower cost of living and plenty of sport fishing opportunity, preferably not in a big city and tornadoes can go right to hell.

                "content": "Commercial fishing is not for everyone. I will tell you that right off the bat. Secondly you should pick your fishery. Do some research and look into the techniques. You can deckhand on an actual fishing boat or you can work on a processing boat. Both are long hours. Let me emphasize long. My experience comes from crab fishing on the west coast. 24 hour days with minimal sleep are the norm. When the fishing is hot you will work until the hold is full. Rest at offloading. The. Head right back out. Processing boats have shifts but still expect long ones. \n\nThe money can be fantastic but it\u2019s also a gamble. You will receive a percentage share for overall catch. If the fish are there you will make money. Some days they aren\u2019t and you work for free. It\u2019s not a guaranteed amount of pay. At the same time it\u2019s exciting and adventurous. But it can get lonely and repetitive. There\u2019s a lot of drugs around fishing ports and people you don\u2019t want to mess around with. Lots of good people. But they are all roughnecks. \n\nHow to get a job in these boats can be tricky. Start with google. See if any boats are hiring through local postings. Processing ships and big outfits may advertise on bigger sites. Usually you gotta walk the docks and meet captains so if you don\u2019t live near a port this can be hard. I have plenty of insight but this is getting long winded. DM me if you want to chat about it. \n\nDon\u2019t get discouraged it can be done but just know it is hard work. Big risk big reward. Yes it is dangerous. Lots of machinery, ropes, lines, hooks that can all cause bodily harm. You get worn down and exhausted and mistakes happen. You have to stay sharp and be aware and put safety first.",

I have fished a couple times per year throughout my life, but had always borrowed my dad\u2019s equipment and never needed to set anything up.  I have a job now and would like to invest in my own equipment plus I am now living in another state.\n \n\nI currently own stuff for hiking, backpacking, and hunting so I have some outdooring equipment, but nothing that is fishing specific.  I have already purchased my fishing license, outdoors card, passport, lodging, and food.  The last equipment I think I will require is the actual rod, reel, tackle, and other fishing equipment.\n \n\nWe will be fishing Fishog Lake in Ontario on a boat.  The fish species will be bass and musky mainly.  They have caught walleye, pike, and sunfish as well on their trips, but they are not the target species.  I don\u2019t think I will have the cash to target both bass and musky effectively so I would like to focus on getting an adequate bass setup and then only buy things for musky if you think I could do that with a little extra in my budget.\n\n \nMy budget for the fishing equipment is around $250.  I could spend a little more if it will be dramatically better, but I would like a low budget fishing setup that will mainly target bass as the goal.\n \n\nI am looking to buy a spinning rod, reel, line, lures, hooks, etc.  Pretend you have zero fishing equipment.  I have looked at the wiki and done a little research and was wondering if these were good ideas.  Would you recommend switching anything out?  Would you recommend buying something?

I was raised in Florida and have been saltwater fishing there for many year, and am bringing up two 4000 and 6000 sized spinning setups I've used for inshore and offshore fishing before. I won't have a boat, but can drive to the Chesapeake or other parts of coastal Virginia for a weekend or day trip to fish from shore. I plan on buying a longer 9' or 10' rod to make longer casts from shore as well.\n\nI've never fished in the area before. I know stripers are popular (and I would LOVE to learn how to fish for them), but what else can I be targeting? I don't mind keeping fish and would love to bring some home on occasion. \n\nAlso, is it worthwhile for me to buy a cast net? Netting bait is a big thing for Florida fishing, but I left mine at home as it just took up too much car space. Is it practical to buy one here if I have no boat?\n\nAny information or advice would be helpful. If anyone would like to try and fish sometime, feel free to PM me!",

        "content": "Beginner tips for fishing northern pike on a lake\nHi all! I'm wondering if I can get some tips, particularly in where to target fish, on fishing for northern pike on a big lake. I'm taking a trip this weekend to a large lake in eastern Pennsylvania. I go with a group who is not particularly into fishing, but is more than happy to take our large pontoon boat out and relax while I do a little fishing. I don't keep fish and all I really want is to take opportunities to target larger-than-normal fish for the few fights that I'm hoping to get in an hour of fishing. For this reason I think pike are my best shot purely for sport reasons.\n\nDo you have any tips in how I should target pike? Ideally I'd like my best bet for a location where I could anchor/drift a pontoon boat while the rest of the crew relaxes for an extended period of time during this upcoming, late May weekend. From my research about lakes and targeting pike at different times of the year, I am thinking my best choice would be to find a calm creek-fed inlet in about \\~10 ft of water with a grassy bed. Please let me know if you think I am wrong in this decision.\n\nI would also like any other tips you have about fishing for pike on a lake! Whether it be how to target, different strategies for different times of year, bait/lure options, etc. Thanks!",

Can you help me pick some gear and give me some tips?\nHey Reddit! \n\nI love fishing but I know very little about it. I grew up in a coastal city in the South Atlantic, and from an early age I was trying to catch some fish. Most of the time I was with my dad, we spent many days casting from the sand into the ocean, but also did a lot of spear fishing (my favorite), and some fishing from boats. While my dad was a great companion, he never really taught me the tricks of fishing, with the exception of spear fishing (I assume because he didn\u2019t want his 10 year old son getting in trouble while 20ft under water). \n\nSince then I moved to the US for school and my dad made all kinds of sacrifices to make sure I was able to follow my dreams. I finished school, got a graduate degree and now have a great job and a great wife. While my finances got a lot better, my dad\u2019s have gone downhill. I want to give back to him in more ways than to just help him financially, so I thought \u201cwhat better way then to fly him here so we can go catch some fish?\u201d \n\nProblem is, I now live in Columbus, Ohio, and I have never fished in fresh water (except for fly fishing in Colorado) and do not know where to start.\n\nCan you give me some tips? What gear should I get? Are there books or websites I can check out for good tips? Mostly people here Fish for bass, muskies, blue gills, but there\u2019s also some trout. I\u2019ve been watching some YouTube videos but there\u2019s so much out there that I feel a little lost. \n\nThanks everyone! I\u2019ll make sure to share pictures here when we actually go fishing! \n\nTL;DR:\nI want to take my dad out fishing as a thanks for all he\u2019s done for me. But I don\u2019t know what gear to buy and how to properly fish for bass, muskies and others in rivers and/or lakes. Do you have any tips for a beginner?",

His peers are dead, and as a former alcoholic he can't really hang out in bars, dive or otherwise.  He misses the ocean and I get that (theoretically - I'm a desert rat, myself), but he talks about his dream of getting back on the water the way a 24 year old does, not a 64 year old.  I've always pussyfooted around this but am about to flat out tell him he's being delusional.  Unless I'm wrong; is there a market for vintage deckhands?",

Work at a bait shop, Bass Pro, etc, and maybe pick up a kayak for fishing on the weekends... that should put his experience to use and get him out on the water without having to cut bait, scrub decks, etc.\n\n",

I've had some success recently fishing from a rock pile during incoming tide, but things are very hit or miss. I've caught several keepers from in the rocks, but some days my bait gets stripped clean seconds after it hits the water. I know there are dozens of small snapper along the rocks and several pesky toadfish.  I'd love some input on the follow questions. \n\nAre the small snapper generally a good indicator that larger ones are there?\nShould I grind it out and keep casting right along the rocks or will the little ones most always beat the larger fish?\nAny suggestions on what my best options to fish for during the outgoing tide. \nIf I'm getting skunked on the rocks would I be better to try and cast out deeper or move to some mangroves. \nAny publicly accessable places you can suggest in the area I mentioned would be greatly appreciated.\n\nFeel free to answer any or all questions, or just throw some tips at me in the comments.

If  you wait till tide change when it nears slack tide this is when the bite gets hot. Guys caught 7 keepers from this bridge yesterday. Today, my girl caught a keeper and we were throwing 12 oz weights . She had a Tog rig ( a double) and fiddlers on both hooks. Kathy nailed a keeper with about 10 guys watching, who were getting skunked because they weren't throwing heavy enough.  \n\n  That's what going on the headboats did for me this winter, made me more confident. Last Sept/ Oct, I was afraid to throw anything more than 5-6 oz. And it was awkward. Today, I was ready to throw up to a pound. My old school rod Eagle Claw 5 ft caster, and Ambassador 5500c had no problem handling that weight. Just wait for the bite once you hit bottom, and don't be afraid to look for deep holes in the rocks , my experience has proven that technique to be somewhat successful, although they do have a tendancy to grab it and lock their fins in the rocks. If this happens, wait it out with slack line. He will eventually make a break for it. \n\nSo get out to the bridge at Townsends Inlet, Corsons Inlet, the jetty in longport nj, or the Atlantic city jetties and catch Tautog\n\nThey're delicious!!!\n\nOh, I have started to use bottom sweeper jigs, so far nothing, but this was my first day Togging this year!! \n\nTight lines\n\n     Today there was heavy water,",

        "content": "Want to try surf fishing for the first time. Gulf coast of FL. Would really appreciate advice for gear and what to do please, thank you!\nWall of text incoming lol. Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nHey everyone, I'm a very new fisherman, I've only fished a few times at my local saltwater river/stream with no luck. I'm in the Tampa/Clearwater area. \n\nI know there's a surf fishing and saltwater subreddit but since this one is much bigger and some of my questions are kind of region specific, I figured I would have a better chance of finding someone who knew the area well here.\n\nI don't have a boat or know anyone with one, so I thought surf fishing looked like a fun compromise.\n\nI've done a little research already on what equipment is needed but I wanted to see what combination you all think would work well. \n\nRod: 10-12' Tica UGSA Series Surf Spinning Fishing Rod. \nI wanted something I could cast really far because I don't want to stand too far into the water. Read a top 10 list that said this rod has the best casting power. I also have no experience with baitcasters and wanted to stick with spinning.\n\nReel: I couldn't decide on this, I feel like there are a lot of good options. Last one I was looking at was a Penn Battle II Spinning Reel. I'm not sure how the compatibility works for these things. I guess I just want something that has plenty of room for line, and spins smooth. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between two if you asked me since I've only ever used the default one on the Ugly Stik GX2.\n\nRig: I was thinking of doing a Carolina Rig. It's honestly about the only rig I know how to do lol, so idk if there's a better option. I've heard of dropper rigs and top bottom rigs and could learn them if they're better.\n\nLures: I'm not a fan of live bait just for the mess and hassle. So I bought some gulp worms, some gulp alive shrimp, and some powerbait shags. They're all on the smaller side so I figure I'll need to get bigger ones right?\n\nHook: I have one of those worm hooks with the offset loop, think it's either 0/2 or 0/4. Those numbers might be flipped, it's a big hook. Should I get a big circle hook instead?\n\nFootwear: Does anyone have any recommendations for this? I cut my foot fishing barefoot once and I don't want to have that happen again.\n\nSand spike: How big of a sand spike should I get? I've never used one before and don't want to be out past knee deep.\n\nLocation: I was thinking about going to Ben T Davis Beach or Honeymoon Island in the Clearwater/Tampa area. Maybe Cypress Point Park. I could use a lot of advice here, idk what fish to expect. I read somewhere it's a good idea to try and be two hours behind or after high tide, true? What do I need to know to have success fishing in these areas?\n\nLine: I was thinking about going with either 20 or 30# braid. I have no idea what to do for the leader. I've heard anything from 16# fluorocarbon to 50# mono. What do you recommend?\n\n\nI know that was a metric f*ckton of text, lol. There's so much more to fishing than I realized when I decided to get into it. I don't expect anyone to answer every question, but anything you guys could help me with I would be very thankful for. I just want to catch a fish damnit lol.",

From what I gather, it seems like the answer is \"it depends,\" and I hear that both can be good, but I'm not quite sure why.\n\nOn top of that, I'm not sure why fisherman like to always go during dusk or dawn, when fluctuating tides occur during the day. Sure fish eat during those times, but fish can eat whenever. I've been using tides4fishing and it seems like there is always more fish activity during an income tide. \n\nFor example, I see high tide is at 8:10 AM and low tide is at 2:17 PM tomorrow in my area. Is it likely that I'll be seeing more fisherman during this period tomorrow? Is it a smart move to say, fish from 11-2 tomorrow?\n\nThank you",

I was on an awkward tide, right at high tide going out. 2 red fish missed my topwater and then another unidentifiable fish did. I spooked what had to be a decent tarpon, looked like 4 feet long in the water and was a bright silver, maybe a nice splash that scared the shit outta me. I\u2019m definitely going out here on an incoming tide. It was also extremely windy which just made everything a pain, so there is that\n\n[Here is a pic of where I waded out. I\u2019m 6\u20194 and this water was up to my waist, so may not be best for shorter people at high tide. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KoTujfE) \nNot many stingray, but the few I saw were MASSIVE. Whales. Also saw one flounder, and over never caught one so I was a little peeved, especially after missing the reds. Coming in at low tide and at least 150 feet off where the water sits in the pic is ankle deep or less. \n\nI\u2019ll stand on shore, rent a kayak or go wading. Idc about the little bit of weather we\u2019ll have as long as the water will be wadeable. Anything saltwater that has even a 1% chance of holding fish lol. I\u2019ll happily go out for a few hours doing nothing but casting lines\n\nWhere do you guys go out? I want to get out ASAP",

        "content": "Fish finders: What the hell am I looking at?\nFish finders: What the hell am I looking at?\nIn this blog series, I will explain how to interpret side scan and downward looking sonar to find structure and fish. This post is part 1 of a 2 in the series about your boat electronics such as fish finders, and side scan sonars.\n\n First, why should you listen to me. To start with my career has been focused on operating underwater drones, collecting side scan data, and interpreting the data as a civilian for the US government. I am a subject matter expert (SME) on utilizing underwater drones and gathering sonar for the US military special operations community. I have analyzed thousands of hours worth of data from different underwater environments all over the world. Enough about me, lets jump right into interpreting what you are actually looking at on your sonar while trying to find places to dive or fish. \n\nWhat is sonar?\n Simply put, sonar stands for Sound Navigation Ranging.  To further explain how sonar works, we should look at what is actually going on during the process of scanning. \n\nSo what are we looking at?\nThe best way to describe side scan imagery is like putting an object on the table and shining a flashlight on the object as you walk by it, see figure below. The major factors that we look at when interpreting side scan sonar are: \nSize \n\nShape \n\nShadow \n\nSonar Return\n\n\nSize\nFirst, the size of an object within your sonar image will be determined by the range of which you have selected to display. The range will help you scale the object within the image. Be sure to set the range according to what you are looking for on the bottom or in the water column. The size of the shadow is also greatly affected by the range at where the object or fish is in relation to the boat. The further away in range, the longer or bigger the shadow will be for that object. This is due to the angle at which the sonar is hitting the fish or object. If you are looking for objects where fish might like to gather and the bottom is relatively sandy, you can usually extend your range to cover more ground due to the rather smooth bottom. Now, if you are looking in an area where the size of the fish are smaller and the bottom is cluttered with debris, you may want to decrease your range in order to see a smaller more detailed picture. This is when the lower frequencies become very useful. For fishing, knowing the size of the fish you are looking and where they might like to be in the water column is critical. \n\nShadow\nShadow is the most helpful factor when interpreting side scan sonar, not so with downward looking sonar. A shadow tells you if an object is in the water column, on the bottom, starting to bury, is solid like a rock or hollow like a lobster trap, how high it is from the bottom, and it also tells you the general shape of an object. In reference to finding fish, shadows will be seen completely detached from the fish reflection because they are in the water column off of the ground. Sometimes will see only a shadow of a fish and nothing else like the example below due the fish being higher in the water column. \n\nOften times fish will accompany objects on the sea floor, and larger fish can be seen near school of bait fish which look like if a swarm of bees was underwater.  If you are looking for bottom in order to locate possible areas where rockfish, halibut, lingcod or bass might be laying around, your best bet is to look for shadow that are touching or attached to an object. Where the shadow is in relation to the object determines the positioning or status of it on the sea floor. Look at the examples below. If the shadow is behind an object, it extends off of the bottom. If the shadow is in front of the object, it is scouring or possible beginning to bury. The reason why it is nice to know what the condition or state of the object is because it will help you decide how to approach diving or fishing on it. Here are some images that you might come across while searching for fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an object is solid, the shadow will be solid black as seen in the ship shadow above. Objects that are not solid appear to have \u201cspotty\u201d shadows and are not solid black throughout. This can be seen above in the image of lobster pots.\n \nSonar Return & Shape\nFor downward looking sonars, size depends on a couple of different things. The first one would be the size and shape of the fish, and the other is the density of the fish or school of fish. The fish image you receive from sonar can look like (1) worms, (2) arcs, (3) big circular masses, or (4) a lot of little spots. Examples are below. \n1.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.\n\n\n\n\n3.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t 4.\nBig reason for this the swim bladders of the fish. A fish\u2019s swim bladder is an organ that is filled with gas. This space provides a much different density than the surrounding water, giving it a much brighter and stronger sonar return. This is why air and metal tend to give off extreme strong returns. Both densities are very different than the density of water by itself. These spots are usually considerably brighter than the rest of the image. The sonar\u2019s sensitivity to density is the reason why strong thermoclines or a layer of murky water can sometimes appear on your sonar as kind of a false bottom. Another good example of this would be looking at kelp on sonar. The gas filled bladders that allow kelp to float have almost a bright white return on sonar (see below). \n\nAdditionally, the fish\u2019s overall shape affects sonar return as well. A football shaped tuna will tend to look like an arc while a white sea bass will look more like a worm due to their longer and straighter body.\nThe shape of the sonar return for an object can very as well depending on material, speed, depth of water and where its orientation is to the sonar transducer. Different types of material reflect varying amount of sonar energy. A shape that is metal and has a flat side facing the transducer has a really strong return and shows up well on the sonar display. However, the same shape with heavy marine growth on it will not display as brightly on the display due to the vegetation absorbing the sonar instead of reflecting it. To further explain this concept, we should look at a radar reflector use by sailboats.\n\n The shape of it is so that there is always a flat side reflecting the radar which acts the same way that sonar does. Materials that reflect well are metals, air, rocks, and concrete. Materials that do not reflect sonar well are softwoods, fiberglass, mud, eelgrass, and other vegetation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Rocks with strong reflection.  Figure 2: A tire with strong reflection from the metal and not from the rubber in it. Figure 3: Eel grass vs sand sonar return.\nAs I mentioned above, density has a lot to do with this which is why using side scan for looking under kelp paddies is more like present/absent than a detailed search. In deeper water, the side scan sonar will look mostly black due to the lack objects in the water column. When kelp paddies, fish, or debris of some kind are present, you can see that some sonar pings are reflective back to the transducer and they are showing up on the sonar display. This is why I typical use side scan for checking kelp paddies and not scanning for tuna. I prefer downward looking sonar for tuna due to the greater angle optimized for depth. Also, I usually have a clue if tunas are in the general area based on reports, birds, etc. They just may be at depth where the angle of the side scan may not reach them at that depth and distance. This is just my opinion based on using my standard electronic equipment. Obviously, there are some powerful and expensive side scan sonars out there that are better than mine.",

He is going to need some sort of education under his belt to get a start. So far I've been to 2 guide schools (one for recreation guiding in northern Maine and another for wilderness/horse packing hunting guiding in NW Montana), I'm currently halfway through an Associate's in Wildlife Management and also tacking on a timber harvesting and tree care occupational cert. I've got myriad little stuff like CPR and First Aid courses completed as well.  The reason I tell you all this is to emphasize that being well rounded is essential to get a job as a guide or any outdoor professional...

I\u2019d say my maths is ok, in my current degree the highest level I\u2019m doing is calc foundations and I\u2019ve been doing fine so far, with physics I\u2019m probably meh at but I\u2019ve been keeping afloat, anyone that\u2019s currently studying mining engineering or has completed study, how hard would you say the duration of your study was? Because I worry while I may be doing ok now, once I transfer to engineering and the concepts get more and more advanced I eventually won\u2019t be able to cope.\n\nWorking in mining and studying mining eng is something I\u2019m really passionate about ever since my time in drilling and even before then, at work I used to find myself spending more time with geologists then my colleagues, so when I left my job I originally intended to study geology but decided on mining eng as it seems like a much more valuable job, but as you can see I have some self doubt and anxiety wether I have the aptitude to even make it through the course.",

There are a ton of abandoned mines up there, mostly silver, gold, and numerous minerals. On a beaten dirt road we spotted a mine that was clearly abandoned and fairly old, probably early 1900s to mid century at the latest guessing on the looks of it and the age of surrounding mines.\n\nIt consisted of a few shafts that were fenced off. Hidden behind the mountain and a hill, there was a small horizontal entrance that you had to crawl through to get in. It was clearly unstable and had a lot of fallen rocks. There was a strong smell of oil (like raw crude) at the entrance. The smell was only at the entrance and first few feet, after that it just smelt dusty. Two of us went in (one stayed out in case something happened) inside there was a ton of rat poop and bat poop but no rats or bats we could spot anywhere. \n\nHowever, around 40 feet in where it started to widen out a little bit, there were several dead mice. A little further and there was a pile of dead mice, around 3 or 4 dozen of them, fairly fresh (most still even had intact eyes). There were no real signs of decay or injury on them. Though they were sunken in a little. At this point we got worried about mine gas and gtfo\u2019d. There had been a large earthquake in the region around 2 weeks before. (Included this as I was wondering if it could\u2019ve cracked some rocks and caused gas to seep)\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? Any clues on what could have caused it?

They can be maximized by thorough inspections to identify and correct potential issues, tracking consumables to properly schedule component replacement, and proper prioritization of maintenance work.\n\n\"Run it till it breaks\" is the worst attitude I've encountered in industry. Good managers do a cost/benefit/risk analysis on every reported problem - determining the likelihood of failure, the amount of downtime that will be incurred by failure, and the amount of downtime that will be incurred by shutting down to fix it. I've seen a mill go down for half a day because of a cascading failure resulting from the superintendent refusing to shut down for twenty minutes to replace missing/loose drive belts. Sometimes running it till it breaks is the right call, sometimes it causes even more problems.\n\nEvery mine I've worked at has had a shorthanded maintenance crew, so intelligently planning a job to efficiently use labor can pay big dividends. Your entire crew should be working at all times unless they're on a break. Likewise, an inventory management system will be hugely helpful in ensuring parts are ordered on time. Nothing worse than your crew sitting around for hours waiting on a part that should have been on hand.",

        "content": "Premier African Mineral's CEO George Roach expands lithium project by 22,000 hectares, potentially making it one of the biggest lithium deposits in the world\nPremier African Mineral's CEO George Roach has recently confirmed on podcast last Friday that an EPO licence to expand its lithium project by 22,00 hectares has been granted. \n\nMost genuine shareholders believe that Zulu is huge and could be good. But just how good isn't easy to visualise. Zulu's Scoping Study or PEA if you prefer to call it that prepared by BARA Consulting helps. In that we\u2019re given some reference pointers that are extremely useful. But although the PEA lays a marker in sand it gives very little guidance on scale and therefore potential which is what investors are keen to see and are understandably very interested in.\n\nWhat BARA have done is prepare a statement of fact on a fully SAMREC compliant but relatively very short length of just one of the known lithium strikes on the existing license area. That's all they're allowed to do and remitted to do. Consultants like BARA aren\u2019t given to speculation. They have to be \u201cmechanical\u201d and deal with what they're asked to do. So BARA put together their excellent report and built a business model around what they considered. That's the extent of it!\n\nBut as I say BARA\u2019s appraisal and models were based upon just 15% of one known strike which is just a small fraction of what's been identified so far on the current licensed area and Zulu\u2019s potential. It follows therefore that BARA\u2019s business models must be minimalist and read in that light. In just about every case mining reserves and resources increase over the LOM and mining plans change accordingly. That will apply nevermore so than in Zulu\u2019s case.\n\nSo Prem took the PEA and from it estimated an overall resource and made their estimate known to shareholders saying it was for guidance only. But what\u00a0 Prems estimate does is give an indication of scale much better than the PEA in that respect. It was based upon drill results and shouldn't be considered as simply as Prems guess. It\u2019s much more accurate and scientific than that.\n\nIf anything Prems estimate is more likely to be conservative than not. Latterly in the drilling campaign Prem undertook further drilling to delineate newly discovered strikes that appeared to run on to the site boundaries and beyond. I believe those findings are just drillers notes so far and are neither disclosed of included in their estimate. To get a better idea of the affect of scale here's some benchmarking and calculations of my own. If I'm near right the results are simply breathtaking!\n\nIf the licensed area stays unaltered and we take Prems highest target resource we have a resource of 160mt's u/1.06% Li2O. Prem derived that from the known and measured strike used in the PEA and extrapolated it on a straightforward pro-rata basis. There were further strikes that were identified towards the end of the drilling campaign too but they weren\u2019t counted in the estimate. The drilling was carried out purposely to delineate those strikes up to the boundaries and perhaps helped to justify Prems EPO application we see today..\n\nSo if we assume the 160mt's is about right. LCE prices are currently about $10.5k/t and the conversion factor to get from LCE to Li2O is x 2.473. So for ease of maths let's say the current Li2O price is $25k/t. That would give Zulu an \u201cin-ground\u201d value of 160m x 1.06% x $25k which is $42.4bn. It\u2019s worth reiterating as I've used it later.\u00a0 $42.4bn!\u00a0\n\nThe largest hard rock lithium resource in the world is owned by AVZ Minerals in the DRC and it\u2019s\u00a0 resource there was increased to over 400mt's u/1.66% Li2O last December giving it an \u201din ground\u201d value of $166bn. Some 4x higher in value than Zulu\u2019s in estimation.\n\nZulu is often benchmarked against Pilbara's mine in Australia too given it's of a similar size with similar grades. But Pilbara is three years or so ahead of Zulu and is in production now. It's resource is 216mt's @ 1.13% Li2O or something like that. So it's \u201cin ground\u201d value is $61bn just less than 50% higher in value than Zulu.\n\nAll very interesting. As is the fact that Zulu\u2019s Lithium is very high quality. It\u00a0 has a very low iron content which sets it\u2019s\u00a0 above most of it\u2019s piers in the space. For that reason it\u2019s sure to be highly sought after come the day.\n\nThese mines are massive and highly profitable by any measure. Pilbara's original mining plan was to produce over 300kt\u2019s of battery grade Spodumene from a ROM of 2mt's/annum\u00a0 giving the mine a LOM of over 20 years. But that's now been changed. Pilbara have doubled the ROM to 5mt's/annum and to catch the current market outlook I presume. It\u2019s market cap from producing 300kt\u2019s of Concentrate is $1.2bn albeit it\u2019s All in Costs are likely to be higher than Zulu\u2019s which bodes well and is very interesting too.\n\nNow here's the sting in the tail. Well for other miners at least. Prems EPO application increases Zulu's mining area from 350ha currently under license to over 22,000ha. That\u2019s 57 x bigger!\n\nSo if you imagine the resource continues at the same density across the EPO area applied for that would give Zulu an \u201cin ground\u201d value of over $2.4 trillion. That\u2019s fifteen times higher in value than the largest mine of it's kind in the world and forty times higher in value than Pilbara. All of a sudden Pilbara starts to take the size of a minnow such is the potential of Zulu!\u00a0\n\nSome like to\u00a0 value mines based on the value \u201cin-ground\u201c. It\u2019s a quick and easy way and it\u2019s a method adopted quite often.\u00a0 We saw GR do it on HBR in the recent Webinar. He quoted\u00a0 $22/ oz Au which is 1.5% or thereabouts of the projects resource. Most that use this say between 1% & 2% is appropriate.\u00a0 So what GR did on HBR fits.\n\nI'm not a fan of this valuation method to be honest. There's better ways to value Zulu. Far better. However now I've mentioned the \u201cin ground \u201c values it's just worth saying that using a factor of 1.5% Zulu's Market Cap on its current area would be almost $640m which suggests a SP contribution of 4p to 5p or thereabouts to Prem. But on its larger area Prems value would be many multiples of that. But whether it would be 57 times more on it\u2019s larger EPO area is questionable in my mind. But a SP of \u00a32.50 or thereabouts which equates to a 3,000 bagger\u00a0 or $3m out of a \u00a31k investment from here might be a slight exaggeration. Ha ha!\u00a0\n\nApparently there's been two objections to Prems EPO application. One on economic grounds which I believe was rejected without much ado. The other was a \"blanket\" application that covered a much larger area that overlapped Prems. But it was made by someone that has no connections to Zimbabwe and never worked there..\u00a0 A \u201ctry on\u201d put simply and because of that it\u2019s been said it too has little chance of full consideration.\n\nAs your probably aware in mining increasing the resource and/or extending the LOM has little impact on Market Caps and Share Prices in most cases. That's understandable given profitability usually remains largely unchanged. If the production level is unaltered it simply means the mine stays operational longer. So no big deal really especially when the LOM is reasonably long at its shortest. However I believe Zulu's situation couldn't be more different.\n\nAs I see it if the licence area remains unchanged we're unlikely to see Zulu plan to produce Lithium Carbonate from a chemical plant on site. Due to current site area constraints if Zulu\u00a0 want to produce Lithium Carbonate we may have to opt for using the shared facility in Bulawayo that\u2019s under construction at the moment and that defeats the object to a degree.\n\nOn the other hand if the licence area increases by a reasonable margin in the current EPO it could be cost effective for Zulu to build its own dedicated chemical plant adjacent to mining operations and ship the Lithium in Carbonate form.\n\nThe difference between the appraisals of the two options is huge particularly in financial terms. One would be good but the other could be exceptional.Truly exceptional if my understanding is anywhere near right.\n\nFor the purposes here I'm going to wear my positive hat and assume Prems EPO application\u00a0 is successful at least in part and that the new enlarged area will be conducive to Carbonate production at the mine site. I'm also going to predict Lithium prices at the point of production a two years out in the case of Concentrate and four to five years out in the case of Carbonate. I\u2019ve been conservative but based my views on increases in market demand and forecasts published by experts.\n\nSo please bear those two things in mind. As I say I\u2019ve tried to be conservative in other areas but in my view they\u2019re factors that shouldn't be ignored and left unconsidered\n\nBattery grade Spodumene is currently selling through offtakers at around $900/t & $1000/t. The current market price for Lithium Carbonate Equivalent on the other hand is around $10,500/t so perhaps through offtakers $7000/t some 7 x higher than >6% Spodumene Concentrate. That\u2019s reflected in the BARA report too. So projected off takers prices then say $2k/t for\u00a0 >6% Spodumene and $20k/t for LCE.\n\nIf I count the Petalite and Tantalum I'll ramble on forever and it's going to make the maths quite difficult to follow. So I've assumed they cancel each other out and ignored them. I think it's a reasonable assumption and conservative too..\n\nI've also used Zulu\u2019s PEA and Prospects Arcadia Mine in Zimbabwe where I can for references to make my statements and calculations more factual and less \u201cdreamy\u201d. There are some key non-disclosures on their offtake agreements in Prospects presentations which is a shame but understandable for confidentiality.\n\nProspect haven't long entered into a seven year offtake agreement with Sinomine a Chinese offtaker on a build and transfer basis. Sinomine have agreed to design and build the mine but then transfer ownership of it to Prospect in a share swap arrangement of $10m for 10% stake and an offtake agreement for 70% of the Lithium Concentrate\u00a0 produced for the next seven years. Prospect have a say in the mines design and take ownership of it when it's built. They pay for it\u2019s cost then over a three year payback period I believe. It sounds a good arrangement but Sinomines payment rates under the agreement are undisclosed so I can\u2019t be entirely sure.\n\nNow\u00a0 here's an interesting part. Prospect have the right under the agreement to divert up to 50% of their Concentrate at any time to an owned Carbonate plant. That is step change for them given they've got the room on site. Their licensed area is 4x the current size of Zulu\u2019s.\n\nArcadia\u2019s\u00a0 forecasting to start production within a year from a \u201cspade in the ground\u201d which is very quick especially considering the climatic conditions has been met. They intended to produce 200 kt's/annum of Lithium Petalite Concentrate and over 150kt\u2019s of Spodumene Concentrate initially and whilst those targets may have been met they\u2019ve just opened a chemical plant and are now\u00a0 producing Carbonate too.\n\nThe Arcadia mine in Zimbabwe is said to be one of the largest hard rock Lithium mines in the world. At 0.2% cut off I think they have a resource of about 75mt's at similar grades to Prem. To put that into perspective Zulu has an assessed but well founded target of twice that and that's just on its current licensed area. Like all appraisals logistics must be considered. It will be the pinch point for Zulu in my view.\u00a0 I doubt we will be able to ship much more than 300kt's/annum of by road to Bulawayo.\n\nSo with my positive hat on I like to imagine Zulu in 3 phases. Viz:-\n\nPHASE1 DFS - I think Zulu could command a\u00a0 $100m to $150m Market Cap at this stage or more subject to reasonable fundamentals which I'm confident we'll see. If there are offers from suitors at this point Zulu\u2019s value could be more. Substantially more and I see that as a real possibility.\n\nI've derived the basic value from Prospects deal with Sinomine where it was given a similar value in the same time & space. So if we have say Prem has10bn shares in issue then we get to a 1p share price contribution to Prem. Fairly straightforward.\n\nPHASE 2 in 2021 Zulu should be producing Lithium Concentrate. $80m Capex or thereabouts will be needed to build a Concentrate facility. So we should expect something like a 25% dilution to raise Capex finance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nZulu should\u00a0 achieve a rate of 2m/t ROM/annum u/1.06% Li2O grade quite easily and similar to it\u2019s industry piers. That would produce 300 kts >6% Spodumene at a quality better than battery grade. With a $1.5k/t offtake agreement that would give Zulu a $450m/annum revenue. C3 costs from the BARA report should be no more than\u00a0 $550/t or $165m annualised . \"Earnings\u201d therefore would be $285m giving Zulu's a notional Market Cap of $2.8bn using a P/E ratio of 10\u00a0 and in turn a contribution to Prems Mare Cap of $2.1bn. Prem having retained 75% ownership. That\u2019s very much in line with Pilbara\u2019s appraisal.\n\nEven if Prem had say 12bn shares in issue by then\u00a0 Zulu would contribute roughly 13p to it's SP at current exchange rates.\n\nPHASE 3 in 2024/2025 - Zulu could be one of the largest producing Lithium Carbonate mines from a hard rock source in the world. If not the largest. At least $500m Capex is going to be needed to build a chemical plant capable of producing 80kt's to 100kt's of Carbonate. I see most of that being funded out off WIP though with very little or no dilution or debt looking at the margins.\n\nProjected revenue from the sale of 80kt's Carbonate should be near $1.6bn/annum and projected AIC\u2019s costs should be around $5k/t so perhaps $400m/annum. The cost figures have come from benchmarking against Zulu's piers.\n\nWith earnings then of $1.1bn the maths tells us we're looking at a Market Cap of $10bn and therefore a contribution to Prems SP of 75p or thereabouts. I said at the beginning of this the figures would be breathtaking and I think that one certainly is! Whilst Prems notional Market Cap wouldn\u2019t be the highest in the Lithium space most but not all of the others are miners processing the metal from solution rather than hard rock.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt's worth reiterating that the figures I\u2019ve arrived at for the Concentrate alternative are projected two years out and those for the Carbonate alternative are projected five years out. We could well be looking at a huge mining operation in Zulu. Perhaps the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nThe ratios of value to cost have been derived from Zulu\u2019s PEA\u00a0 and there\u2019s some rounding for ease of maths.\n\nIt's not too difficult to imagine Zulu and/or Prem coming under pressure from hostile takeover offers at or even before the point of DFS. Especially if the licenced area is increased. I've made Prem\u2019s\u00a0 management aware of my concerns and asked them to do whatever they can to protect us all as much as possible and to take steps  \nto mitigate this risk.\n\nAIMHO & GLA genuine shareholders.\n\nTedoby",

        "content": "Mining Engineering vs Metallurgical Engineering (Physical Metallurgy)\nI'm in 7th semester (overall 10 semesters) of my undergraduate studies for my diploma in \"Mining and Metallurgical Engineering\" at Athens Technical University in Greece. Note that the diploma is acknowledged as an undergraduate master.  At the moment I am very confused which branch to select for the last 3 semesters of my program, cause I have to choose 1 direction. I find materials engineering interesting as well as mining (and thinking to go for a Petroleum Master after I complete my studies). The diploma references as \"Mining and Metallurgical Engineering\", so as you can see it isn't too specified, that's why I am in a huge dilemma.\n\nI have a few questions: Which branch has better paychecks? Which branch demands traveling abroad to find a decent job? How are the job prospects for each branch?\n\nPlus I got an internship offer from IAESTE to work for Arcelor Mittal in electrical steels R&D sector for 7 months. So that prospect intensifies my dilemma. What do you think? I can't decide, cause I don't mind studying materials engineering, but can I truly want work in O&G industry with an corresponding master (for example at TU Delft). So what do you think? Will the future employer be content with a petroleum master or he will reject me cause I chose materials as a final study direction? Can a materials engineer work at O&G industry? Or should I choose exclusively mining for this purpose?\n\nThank you in advance!",

In my experience mining is just one big frat house lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, mining engineers make slightly more than metallurgical/plant/proicess engineers in a mine.  If you're a metallurgical engineer in a steel making facility, aluminum smelter, refinery you won't make much to be honest.  Those types of places tend to be fairly close to a city so the employer doesn't pay extra for remote placement.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere you make the good money is at a mine which will (mostly) force you to work remotely.  But if you want really good cash that's what will happen.  There are so many opportunities out there though.  Some mines offer fly-in fly-out (FIFO) and will fly you home after a rotation.  I love those, but they take their toll on your mental health and social life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM if you want to know more.  I've been in the industry for close to 10 years.",

        "content": "Premier African Mineral's RHA Tungsten Mine close to coming back to production\nAs an overview RHA is located approximately 20 km south-east of Hwange and 270 km north of Bulawayo in the prospective multi-commodity Kamativi Tin Belt in north-west Zimbabwe. It sits in its own licence area of 1800ha or 4400 acres which is roughly\u00a0 five times bigger than Zulu under its\u00a0 current license area and slightly bigger than the Scilly Isles for perspective.\n\nPicture the scene of a disused and long abandoned\u00a0 mine in the middle of the Zimbabwean countryside as it was when Prem first saw it in\u00a0 2012. The site was overgrown and the old shaft there must have been like an old well full of foul smelling run off rainwater . The shaft was accessible via two adits one North and one South which were relatively small but clearly visible. They still exist and are in use today I believe.  \n\n\nCrossing the mining area was a low ridge approximately 850 m long and 300 m wide standing about 120 m above its surroundings.\u00a0\n\nThere was known to be mineralised ore body that included wolframite and copper in a strike approximately 400 m long and 150 m wide. Grades of the WO3 were found to improve in a south easterly direction towards the existing shaft and at depth. Seven Lodes were identified and they were previously exploited early in part\u00a0 in the mines 100 year history.\u00a0\n\nThe old mine workings were in the form of an underground mine with two adits, open pits, caved stopes, trenches, roads and rock dumps that occupied the surface. Tailings and\u00a0 dumps were located on the north and south sides of the ridge and complete the picture.  \n\n\nRHA comprised\u00a0 50 mineral claim in the 1800 Ha, consisting of 10 owned by Prem and 40 under option.\n\nSmall-scale surface and underground mining was conducted at the site between 1931 and 1979, with total production from the mine is\u00a0 standing at 1 247,65 tonnes of WO3 in concentrate containing 65 percent APT.\n\nIntermittent small scale mining was\u00a0 carried out at both RHA and the adjacent much smaller Tung mine (which Prem had an option over at the time) between 1931 and 1979.\u00a0 The mines jointly produced 1,247 tonnes of wolframite concentrate at an average concentrate grade of 65% WO3. So perhaps 80,000mtu was produced at RHA which today would have a sale price of just $210m.\n\nThe mine workings were almost entirely carried out during the 1930s where the underground\u00a0 mine which was accessed via the two adits in the sides of the ridge and a single vertical shaft down to the 845m level.\u00a0\n\nSome open pitting was also carried out mainly in the western part of the strike.  \nDuring the mid to late 1970s Falconbridge Ltd, trading as Blanket Mines in Zimbabwe, carried out underground geological mapping and extensive channel sampling on the accessible parts of the underground workings, principally on the 926, 895 and 859 levels.\u00a0\n\nTheir exploration work had to be curtailed . But undoubtedly this mapping together with any previous data would have formed an integral part of Prems due diligence and would have helped in the preparation of RHA\u2019s first Scoping Study which was to be completed later in 2013.\u00a0\n\nPrem joined the AIM market mid December in 2012 and by that time it had purchased RHA in a\u00a0 j.v. with the Governments Fund NIEEF by necessity.  \n\n\nThe j.v. had been formed under a Letter of Intent at the time and Prem through its subsidiary owned 49% of the mine in keeping with the indigenisation law that was in place.\u00a0\n\nEarly in 2013 saw further drill results announced as RHA was working towards a SAMREC code compliant resource and it\u2019s PEA or Scoping Study as it\u2019s also known.  \nIn August that year Prem announced RHA\u2019s PEA that confirmed its SAMREC compliant resource.This was the first milestone for the mine un it\u2019s j.v.\u2019s ownership.\u00a0\n\nThe study was minimalist and simply based on an extension of\u00a0 Lode 2 out of the 7 Lodes identified at the mine. Lode 2 then became known as Lodes 2A for the original length & 2B for it\u2019s extension.\u00a0\n\nNevertheless the Assessment confirmed the economic potential of Lode 2 in isolation demonstrated it would support a tungsten mining operation with an annual\u00a0 Run of Mine rate of 192kt\u2019s from an open pit and underground mining strategy over a six year LOM from just $13.5m Capex.  \n\n\nOther projected fundamentals such as an NPV of $118m an\u00a0 IRR of over 300% and Free Cash Flows in excess of $20m/annum\u00a0 were equally encouraging at the time.  \n\n\nTungsten\u00a0 prices were then almost twice what they are now at around $400/mtu APT and that figure was the one used in the study. All very acceptable if not attractive.  \n\n\nMost significantly really good news ensued shortly after Prem joined the market. It came from discovering a significant new Lode extension in late in 2013.  \n\n\nFurther drilling was carried out on what was then identified as Lode 2A until December that year. Some extremely high grades were identified as well as many new WO3 veins in the Lodes. The results were then RNS\u2019d on 13th March 2014.  \n\n\nThese drilling results were stella and they rocked the market to its vore as no doubt some long term shareholders invested at the time will recall.\u00a0\n\nThe grades were consistently higher than had been previously identified. But the highest was a world record testing\u00a0 35% WO3. More than 350kg/t.\u00a0 Simply incredible and jaw dropping. Hitherto the j.v. partners were looking at grades of 0.8% or 8kg/t as exceptional.\u00a0\n\nThe new Lodes\u00a0 were categorised as Lodes 1E.1W.1FW & 1FE and were announced in a further RNS on May 1 2014. The discoveries were to increase the resource by a further 1.3mt\u2019s at an average grade of over 1% or 10kg's/t. A huge increase and the overall effect on RHA was transformational.\u00a0\n\nThis is what the press had to say:-  \n\u201cThe measured and indicated resource has been upped by a staggering 957% to 1.55mln tonnes at a composite grade of 8.0 kg/t WO3, while there is 1.2mln tonnes at a composite grade of 9.7kg/t WO3 in the inferred category.\u201d\n\n[http://zimbabweinvestor.com/premier-african-minerals-soars-on-massive-zimbabwe-resource-upgrade-agrees-ethiopia-bridging-loan/](http://zimbabweinvestor.com/premier-african-minerals-soars-on-massive-zimbabwe-resource-upgrade-agrees-ethiopia-bridging-loan/)  \n\n\nThe period that followed up to the time when RHA was put on care & maintenance in January 2018 would see a myriad of further changes to the resource and mining plan. The changes wern\u2019t all brought about just by the ongoing route in APT prices and the difficulty of raising debt finance especially but those two factors clearly had quite an influence.  \n\n\nMostly they came about from RHA gaining a much better understanding of the mineralisation on the site through further exploration and drilling campaigns. An understanding that has been costly and time consuming to say the least.  \n\n\nI could go on and on but let's fast forward to where are now. Now we have a much better understanding of the resource and in particular where the higher grades of WO3 are located in the underground mine.  \n\n\nAlthough the existing pit is covered by a layer of\u00a0 blown in silt and debris we know from drill results that the strike runs generally in an East/ West direction and the WO3 grade improves on strike towards the existing shaft and at the same time at depth as new blocks have been identified.  \n\n\nWe also know that that is a small amount of WO3 located in the old tailings and that that is readily accessible and easy to deliver to the ROM pad to compliment the rest of the WO3.  \n\n\nAlthough Prem haven't disclosed a new mining plan yet it seems the mine will be restarted more or less where it left off with the added bonus that it\u2019ll be electrified from the grid.  \n\n\nHopefully with higher grades being accessible from the newly cut stopes the mine will be profitable shortly after it restarts.  \n\n\nAs with any mine RHA needs to be optimised and then run in a steady state.  \n\n\nWhen the mine restarts mining will be restricted to\u00a0 underground via the old shafts and adits. The anticipated fundamentals include a ROM of 6kt's/month at a grade of around 0.7% at least hopefully.  \n\n\nTo completely\u00a0 optimise the mine\u00a0 it needs further investment the new semi automated incline shaft built. Once built that will not only allow the mining rate to be increased to more than double but also allow unfettered access to mine the pit.  \n\n\nWhen that's done in say a years time.the ROM should be around 40kts /month and subject to APT prices we should see a contribution to Prems MC from it of perhaps \u00a360m even at suppressed APT prices.\u00a0\n\nIf APT prices were to be around the $400/mtu APT forecast by many industry experts it will be an extremely attractive asset for Prem. Perhaps as much as 1p on Prems SP as things stand.  \n\n\nSo FWIW I think we'll see Commercial Production reached within a month or so of the mine restarting and at that point RHA's impairment [removed.at](http://removed.at/) that point I have Prems fair value of the asset at $20m which represents 0.15p on its SP.  \n\n\nIn cash terms Prem should begin to receive an income under its newly negotiated Rental Agreement and its new Management Contact incorporated in the head Shareholder Agreement on RHA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFrom the old agreement I have those combined to be over $750k/annum. But I'm not entirely sure. Payments to Prem under its Loan Agreement needs to be considered too but as yet the details are undisclosed..  \n\n\nI hope some of this is of interest. But more than that I hope \"RHA has its day in the sun\" as GR tells us.  \n\n\nAIMHO and fingers crossed.\u00a0  \n \n\nTedoby",

        "content": "King Copper\u2019s Ghost: The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Natural Resource Curse\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of an Ebola outbreak that has cost the lives of 191 individuals. Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today\u2019s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo\u2019s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.\n\nMany of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold\u2019s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took \u201cthe White Man\u2019s Burden\u201d seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.\n\nThe achievements of the Belgian Congo were financed by the rich reserves of copper in the Katanga province of Congo, and UMHK, an Ango-Belgian conglomerate, sent the bulk of its profits to Europe.\u00a0The Belgian colonial government deliberately privileged certain ethnic minorities to create ethnic conflict they could manipulate. Above all, the Belgian government saw Africans as little more than big children and presumed they would rule indefinitely. The education made primary education readily available, but only a handful of university graduates. At independence there wasn\u2019t a single African military officer in the police and security forces, and no Africans in the colonial administration with real authority. The Belgians left the Congolese as unprepared as possible for independence.\n\nAfter independence, the United States supported the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a brutal and corrupt dictator because he was strongly anti-Communist.\u00a0 At first, the mines ran much as before, with mining output reaching all time highs of around 500,000 tons in the late 1970s. However, the government assumed the period of high commodity prices would last forever, and so did not maintain large financial buffers, or invest in maintenance. Instead, the Congolese elite consumed the wealth with avarice. The fall of the USSR proved a disaster for Mobutu mean the end of vital American support. The power lines that connected the mines in the interior to hydro-electric power plants on the coast were cut by militias, and rioters chased the ethnic minority that held the majority of management jobs in the mines. Mining output decreased from close 500,000 tons of copper to 35,000 in 1993. In 1994, millions of Rwandans refugees fled into the Congo in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, sparking the brutal Congo Wars and putting the final nail in the coffin in the Congolese mining industry.\n\nThe DRC\u2019s mining industry has steadily rebuilt itself after the end of the Second Congolese war in 2003. Cobalt has emerged as a key component in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries used in electrical cars. Soaring demand has led to the price of cobalt more than doubling over the last two years to $50,000. While some electric car companies, such as Tesla, are attempting to minimize the use of cobalt, demand is likely to soar in coming years. Whether the Congo benefits from this boom is a more complicated question. About one fifth of the cobalt is comes from artisanal mines, where wages are low and workers as young as seven.\u00a0 Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who financed the father of the current dictator\u2019s rise to power, controls the allocation of new mining permits. The Inga-Kolwezi transmission lines that connect hydro-power dams at the mouth of the Congo to Katanga only generate power for the mines, but not the surviving villages. While export revenues have soared, it is unclear if Congo has the institutions to transform this into prosperity for ordinary people.\n\nThe DRC\u2019s natural resource wealth has not benefited ordinary people because those in charge have little incentive to do so. The Belgians had no incentive to make to Congolese capable of self rule. Mobutu had little incentive to allow the countries resource wealth to benefit those not connected to his regime. The current regime does not seem able to use Congo\u2019s resource wealth in a way that benefits the country. The news stories coming out of Congo are almost universally tragic, whether it is civil war or epidemic. Changing the narrative about the Congo will require reforming the countries institutions. Lets hope this time the Congo manages to do so.\n\n# Selected Sources\n\n[Copper Giants Lessons from State-Owned Mining Companies in the DRC and Zambia](https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/nrgi_nmc_english.pdf)\n\n[MORE CONTINUITY THAN CHANGE?

        "content": "Different types of factory\n  Factories are not all the same. They have different corporate cultures and ways of working. Read this one to understand differences between a Taiwanese, Japanese and mainlander factory. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\n  In my last piece I talked about the organizations within a factory and things to be aware of when looking for one for your product. Other than that, have you wondered if there are other things set factories apart? Their corporate culture and ways of working, and understanding their differences helps you greatly in working with one. \n\nSince China opened its door to foreign investments in early 1980s, people from all over the world came in and set up their factories in mainland China. These people have brought their unique culture and ways of working into the factories they set up. I\u2019d like to share a few today. \n\n1) Taiwanese factory\n\nAfter a serious of interviews that went nowhere, I finally got a job at a medium-size Taiwanese factory in Dongguan, Guangdong, then manufacturing hub of the world. That was early 2006 and I was 17, away from home for the first time.\n\nI was working as an assistant for the tooling manager. The Job was not demanding but did involve lots of repetitive paper work. It did not take long for me to pick it up and felt comfortable with the role. I started to make friends with girls working at other teams and noticed some of the interesting things at the factory. \n\na. All formal documents were written in traditional Chinese, which was a bit hard to understand for mainland employees as we\u2019re taught the simplified version. Traditional Chinese has been using in Taiwan and the managers brought it over as well.\n\nb. Emphasizing on individual manners was part of the company culture. Everyone at the factory was expected to behave in friendly, gentle tone towards one another. You may think acting with politeness should be the norm. However that\u2019s the only company I worked at that made an emphasis on it. It really helped to keep the positive energy flow among the team.\n\nc. Religious practice had a place at the factory. Just like any mainlanders would go visit the temple or their local Buddha houses on various holidays throughout the year, Taiwanese managers would worship the Buddha they set up at the factory. Religious practice was not new to me, but bringing it into a business facility was. I guess they\u2019re hoping the Buddha would bring prosperous to the factory.\n\nd. Operation of the factory. Like other Taiwanese factories, the one I worked at were operating with the know-how they brought from Taiwan. That included processes & system for production management. As a result, it generally delivers good and consistent quality, at a slightly higher overhead than factories run by mainlanders. \n\nSadly, the factory was closed in 2017 when I looked it up today. Maybe the increase of labor cost in mainland China and more competition with mainlander factories made earning a profit harder for them. \n\n2) Japanese factory \n\nAimed with the English skills and an associate degree I earned while working at the Taiwanese factory, I started looking for new job opportunities. That was 2009, 3 years after working at the former. I became an English translator, later evolved to new product development manager at a sizeable Japanese factory in the same city. The factory was a glasses (eyewear) frame manufacturer. The California-based glasses company Oakley was one of its key clients. I was the one connecting our engineers at the factory and the engineers at Oakley.\n\nNew job at the Japanese factory not only paid more, but offered more benefits as well. To start with, employees were housed better. I no longer needed to share a dorm with 5 other girls. Instead, I lived in a much nicer one bedroom apartment with 2 other girls. Food at the canteen was noticeably better than the last factory as well. \n\nIn addition, the factory also had a library, general store, an ATM machine, standard-sized basketball, football court for all employees. It also went a bit further to care for its people. Other than stationaries, all workers in the office would be given a roll of toilet paper at the beginning of every month. A medical doctor was always available at the doctor\u2019s office within the factory. Basically, all your essential needs could be fulfilled without stepping out of the factory gate.\n\nIn terms of its culture\n\na. One of the best places for fresh graduates to work, thanks to its well established processes & standards for almost everything and dedicated mentors.\n\nb. Off work activities with the team you work with on various occasions were a big part of the company culture. Welcoming a new coworker, farewell someone who was about to be leaving, or festivals throughout the year were all excuses to go out and enjoy a nice meal together. I enjoyed these occasions and felt it was a good way to bond people together and make communications at work easier.\n\nc. Due to the language barrier, instead of appointing Japanese as managers for various teams/department across the factory, these roles were filled by local employees. That allowed more room for them to climb the corporate ladder. Some of them even went as high as senior managers or VPs at the factory, which was unheard of at Taiwanese factories.\n\nAs for operation, Japanese are well-known for their obsession with product quality. However they\u2019re generally a bit conservative when it comes to commit delivery dates. Production may take a bit longer than others, but they mostly do stick to their commitments.\n\nThat factory still runs as of today, however its size has been reduced by more than half. A friend of mine has been working at one of Sony\u2019s factories in China for almost a decade, until it got acquired by a domestic (mainlander) company. I guess the rise of labor cost has affected them as well.\n\n3) Mainlander factory\n\nThat is, a factory set up and run by people from mainland China. It is the most interesting one to me. \n\nDuring my time at the Japanese factory, I earned an undergraduate in Business English. Then, when I was ready to move on, I found a cultural exchange program and moved to the US for a gap year to learn its culture and improve my English. When I came back from the gap year in early 2014, I started working as a project manager for a consumer electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen. It\u2019s a mainlander factory and I am still working there to this day.\n\nPay at the new job is considerably more than my last one, so does its workload and stress. Working in the evenings, or even weekends are expected, to move things faster. The term \u201c996\u201d, that is 9am to 9pm for 6 days a week, has become a hated reality at many mainlander companies in recent years. \n\nOther than longer hours, another thing that sets a mainlander factory apart with other foreign-invested factories is its attitude towards changes. Since most of them has a shorter history than the later and are still in the process of setting up solid processes &system to manage the business, they would not hesitant to change a rule if it does not work well. And they don\u2019t mind to do it frequently either. Translation: working at a mainlander factory sometimes may feel like walking in a jungle and it could be messy!\n\nMainlander factories in general, are able to offer products at lower costs and shorter time. However, it may come with an invisible cost. Depending on the size of the factory and its capabilities, they may not able to manage its production quality effectively. In other words, you as the client may have to step in to help or accept minor defects occasionally.",

        "content": "How is a factory organized?\n The idea of a factory used to be a magical place for me. The first time I learned about it was from my cousins when I was still in elementary school. They were home for Chinese New Year from the factory they\u2019re working at and talking about their life there by the dinner table. \n\nMy cousins, as well as many of the migrant workers in our village, were dropouts or graduates of middle school. Going to work for a factory afterwards was the mainstream path for them. The correlation between a better education and a better paying job later was too distant for many parents and students. Earning money to keep food on the table and a roof over head was far more urgent. \n\nAnd a factory was the place that made it happen. Over time, all of my cousin\u2019s and villager\u2019s families were able to afford better standard of living. I was a bit amazed to see that even with a middle school education or less, you could go work at a factory and earn a decent living in our village. It\u2019s the place everyone could go and make a better life for themselves. \n\nBut how does a factory is organized? How does it work? I had no idea until I started working at one many years later. \n\nFactories vary in sizes and the products they are making. However, any factory, regardless of its size or field should have following personal/team/department serves these functions. \n\n1) Sales. They\u2019re the first line of people you may interact with if you wish you establish a business relationship with a factory. You may find then on Alibaba.com or various trade shows. A preferred way is through connections. Ask whoever you know is already working with factories and ask them, or their connections to recommend factories they trust. It\u2019s the approach that could save you many bumps on the road if you fumble on your own.\n\nBe mindful that some of sales people you talk to may not work for a factory. Instead, they work for a middle-man company that sources the products from factories and resell to you at a profit. Like other things in life, having a middle-man in between sometimes could be the recipe for miscommunication, taking longer to get things done and surely cost you more. I\u2019d recommend you try to work with a factory directly, as its advantages almost ways outweighs its drudgery.\n\n2) Engineering. If you are just sourcing an off-shelf product from the factory, you may have very little interaction with its engineering team. However, if you like to source something unique and have the factory customizes for you , chances are you would be having quite a lot discussions & meetings with the engineering team to make sure the design is manufacturable.  \n\nThere is an iron triangle in the manufacturing world. That is, cost, quality and time. A design may looks great and unique, however it may costs many times more than your budget to have it mass produced. Or, if you are not willing to pay more, chances are quality of the product are going to be reduced at a longer lead time. Be prepared to make compromises on your product design to reach the sweet spot of best cost, quality and time. Before doing so, seize every opportunity to educate yourself different aspects of the production process so you know when to push back and where to make compromises. \n\nA factory may charge NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) for the amount of engineering work they\u2019re expected to do. The basic calculation of NRE is the number of engineering members, plus the length of time, times by their labor costs. \n\nThe factory may also present samples during engineering development stage at additional cost. Depending on the type of products, you may ask for non-working samples (mechanical demonstration of the design), working samples (demonstration of all or most of the performing features) or even color samples (color matches your spec) and more. The quantity and types of samples are negotiable.\n\n3) Production. It is usually the largest department in any given factory and its role is to scale up production once the engineering team has finished their development/validation. Ask how many production lines the factory has and yield rates of them, to help yourself run estimates of how much time would it take to get what you plan to order. \n\n4) Quality. Needless to say, it is the team that manages quality of the products. To access a factory\u2019s capability to manage its product quality, you may start with asking questions like how a certain product should be tested to understand its reliability. If the factory has been making that type of products, they should be able to produce a reliability testing plan with detailed testing standards.\n\nOr, when you have a chance to visit the factory, pay attention to if what you were told matches with what you are seeing on the site. For example, if defective parts on the production line are being isolated as they supposed to be? Or ask to see records of IQC (Incoming Quality Control) to see if it matches with whatever process it should follow through. \n\n5) Sourcing. The factory I work at source headphone parts from our partners, so that we can do its assembly and packing. The partners we work with source raw materials from their supply chain so that they can deliver the parts to us. Regardless of its size, any factory will need to source something for its production. That something could be a tangible component, a production process, or intangible licenses to program into the products.\n\nHow a factory manage its sourcing could potentially affects the final product costs and quality. If opportunities allows, try to understand what is the sourcing team\u2019s approach to get the best price in the market? And how do they manage the supply risk of a high-demand or critical part? \n\n6) Importing, exporting and finance. The size of the factory determines the number of people working on these teams. You may have little transaction with them as they are not directly relating to the production of the products. \n\n7) HR and administration. Yeah, they are the ones working behind the scene and mostly serving for the people working at the factory. This may sound strange to you, but most of the factories have canteen, dorms and sometimes even library, ATM machine, or convenience store etc. for its employees. The unique thing about a Chinese factory is that it could function like a closed-community and workers may not have to step outside the gate to get everything they need. \n\nI wonder whoever had factories designed that way shares the same mentality as the ones designed casinos? The results seem to suggest they\u2019ve arrived at the same destination, where both factory workers and gamblers are all sitting happily in the space they\u2019re designed to be days, weeks or even months on end. \n\nThat\u2019s a basic layout of how a factory is organized. I hope it helped to answer some of the questions you might have. I\u2019d like to remind you pay particular attention to those teams of a factory after you\u2019ve gone through the sales and like to know more about it through in-depth discussion or a visit. It is the performance of their job determines the quality of the product/service you\u2019ll be getting. \n\nNext week, I plan to share the differences among factories run by Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Konger, mainlander, etc. All of them had their factories set up in mainland China but run it with different approaches. It is interesting to observe the differences in culture and ways of working.",

Very few outsiders. We also specialize in undesirable employees. Such as people in rehab houses, ex cons PTSD sufferers, people really down on their luck. We take these people into our family and we try to help them help theirselves. The other employees make sure they have lunch we call and check on them if they are late. We share our own hard luck experiences with them on breaks. We give advice. We have two women whose husbands have terminal cancer. We employ a lot of well past retirement people also. With 12 people in the dept we need everyone but they both have to take extended time off and we all just work around it. It takes a lot to get fired, if you can't do a job you are just sent to every position until you can do something. We have even helped other employees go to rehab when they start showing signs of an addiction. So I wanna know if this is how most factories are because I have never worked anywhere else.",

And rest are rental workers, like I was, who at best are kept around or stay around for an year or two. No one asks, cares, or wants to hear about your private life. Other than those few old dudes, in the break room no one wants to talk. In one factory, they actually didn't even put the lights on during the break so people could take a quick nap.    \n\n\nIt isn't uncommon to stay a year somewhere, and never learn the names of the people you work with. Hell... it is common to not even have a common language. The dude in the next welding unit might only speak Russian, or Polish. You won't know. Only way to get to know people is to take smoke breaks, that is usually where people do at least basic chatting.  \n\n\nSince rental work is so common, at least here. Being late, not being productive, or having issues is grounds for not getting your order continues. It isn't the same as being fired, because you don't work for the company where you work at, you work for the rental agency. This has it's benefits. Like being able to get out of a contract quickly and there are no downsides to it, and you are never tied to the contract. If you find a better paid job or otherwise better job, like I did few times, I could basically leave with a days notice.  \n\n\nBut what you got there, sounds totally unique.",

If it is a profitable and small niche business with few competitors, then such a community/employee friendly business can be sustained.\n\nAs you get into highly competitive markets, productivity and cost become too important. Unproductive employees are dropped. Waste is eliminated in all areas. Automation, where cost effective, is heavily used. Outsourcing work to foreign markets is a matter of course. If your company doesn't do this, then they get easily out-competed by a company who does and they lose the business. \n\nIt makes sense - company A provides a part at 60 cents, company B provides the same exact part at 45 cents because they have no waste to pay for.

Not so much necessarily on the \"undesirables\" thing but once you're \"in\" the company really does it's best to make sure you succeed. We have a lot of really hard workers and the workforce here is all long term. The number or people who retire from here with 35+ plus years is unreal, plus the ones that have been here for 20+ and will be here until the end. The company really does it's best to accommodate those who end up needing special or limited hours because of injury or illness. It is a small, family owned steel fab shop with 75-100 employees. I think some of the biggest factors that keep people here are that the owners work in and on the business, company events (small stuff like bowling, annual golf tournament, very nice Christmas party, ect) and the pay. \n\nThey don't pay a lot hourly, supposedly to keep things lean and us nimble with cash flow, BUT they more than make up for it in bonuses. I think how they pay makes employees focus on the bottom line big time! I made 6 figures last year where half was from my hourly and half was in the form of bonuses. Most companies would be happy to pay their people maybe $50-60k and then the owners make millions. On top of all that they do a small 401k match and STILL have their own profit sharing plan where employees are fully vested after about 7 years.",

I did some work in research and innovation, but my lack of advanced degree hindered me.\n\nSo here I am working shifts, running around a factory fixing stuff. It is a good life and I am happy with my pay.

Management uses the term SMED, but I see no evidence that anyone knows what it means.\n\nI'm 40 now, so maybe I should just run with what I've got as long as I can.

Google is all about TOTAL NOISE CANCELLATION, which I cannot have cuz yeah, overhead radio neccessary. \n\n\n2. My Feet\n\n\nThe company provides awesome CAT boots- one pair per year. We are offered a choice of steel, composite, or plain toe. Unfortunately, we had to make the choice at orientation when I hadn't yet worked a single day o' factory in my life. I already own a pair of steels and a pair of plains (I love boots cuz I am a lady obsessed with good footwear) so I chose composite. Wearing my steels, I noticed they are HORRIBLE for working in a giant refrigerator (again; it's a dairy). My toes get super wet because steel don't breathe. Are composites gonna suck, too?\n\n\nAlso! Let's talk insoles. I got thise $7 Dr Scholls from Meijer. They're better than nothing but just o.k. any favorites I should save up for? \n\nAs for socks- I am set. Bought a 6 pack of merino wool socks from Costco for $20. These babies breathe, soak sweat and keep my feet toasty. I wish I could buy everyone I work with a set or 2.\n\n\n3. My Back\nI work in the box room solo. This means I load a banded pile of 20 boxes into 3 machines from 3 pallets repeatedly. The machines all have their own personalities and fuck up in unique ways. I fix what I can and call maintenance when I can't. I lift about 30 lbs repeatedly. I know about proper lifting from catering, but hot damn! Should i get a back brace or something?",

A place where multi level production orders that are made-to-order and made-to-stock meet and the whole planning has to deal with constant customer changeovers that affect the long term and the short term production plan.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to do everything on time and in sufficent quality if you have to manually download orders from ERP, create a plan in excel, then print it (or upload the excel to another system for sequencing) and then carry the finished papertrail around the factory. And when you are done a series of changeovers comes, because a bunch of people down the stream ordered something new and want it quickly.\n\nBMW solved this in 2010 by creating one web based system stretched along the planners, line operators, line feeders and expedition and by being very strict with the purity of their data in ERP. \n\nHow are you dealing with these issues in your plants? \n\nDo you use a web based, ERP synced, touch and mobile friendly solution that allows you to have a paperless production planning and scheduling, where adapting to customer changeovers is a matter of drag and dropping an order to a more suitable time slot and the system re-orchestrates everything else based on a preset scenario?\n\nOr even planning the production artificially, where if there is a particular order in the system and a particular material in the supermarket together with a particular raw material in stock, the system just creates a production order without an input from the planner, he\\\\she just confirms and fine-tunes the sequence if any adjustments are needed?\n\nI really like my job, since it is saving tons of money and time and unlocks new potential in manufacturing. \n\nYeah, this is a Saturday blog post from a sales guy, I hope everyone here is having a wonderful weekend.",

        "content": "Ghirardelli's Secret Recipe: Staying Lean\nBy Christine Torres  \n\n\nGhirardelli Chocolate Company prides itself as a smooth operator. That\u2019s heavily thanks to the company\u2019s culture of zero losses and a steadfast commitment to lean, according to Helen Tan, lean manufacturing engineer at the Bay Area chocolatier\u2019s manufacturing facility. Even with intense pressures to produce enough delicious confections in time for holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas, production must follow a solid plan that\u2019s been integral to the [Ghirardelli brand](https://www.ghirardelli.com/)\u2019s foundation.\n\n## Strong Foundation\n\nSince 1852, Ghirardelli has set itself apart from other chocolate manufacturers by branding its quality and centralizing its capacity. Through modern improvements to its traditional chocolate-making process, the company (part of Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli AG) thrives among the [top chocolatiers in the world](https://www.icco.org/about-cocoa/chocolate-industry.html).\n\nAn official San Francisco landmark, the famous Ghirardelli illuminated light bulb sign is visible for miles. It is a welcome sight to air travelers and ships passing through the Golden Gate Strait. A popular tourist destination, Ghirardelli Square delights visitors with intimate views of the chocolate-making process, which is set inside a large Victorian-style complex blocks from San Francisco Bay. Huge sacks of raw cocoa beans come in from throughout the world, which are processed into nibs before entering a liquefied chocolate format.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChocolate is very fickle,\u201d Tan said, whose favorite is Ghirardelli\u2019s dark chocolate Sea Salt Soiree. \u201cWe need to be careful with how we temper it to produce the best crystalline structure and reduce any defects downstream.\u201d\n\nAs an industrial performance engineer, Tan leads the facility\u2019s [Total Productive Maintenance program](https://www.graphicproducts.com/infographics/pillars-of-tpm/). \u201cWe try to instill a culture of zero losses, engaging 100% of the workforce, and empowering them to own their respective factory equipment and brainstorm solutions to problems on the shop floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBy instilling a lean culture, we hope that Ghirardelli transforms to a state of pure Zen\u2014happy machines and happy workers.\u201d\n\n## Lean Essentials\n\nPart of Ghirardelli\u2019s lean master plan to reduce losses and breakdown time includes designated teams, one of which that focuses on improving [tools for 5S](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/tools-for-5s/). Tan says besides having smooth production lines and tools in their proper place, operators are engaged and looking out for hazards and risks. Improvements in the process and re-training are common solutions for worker safety.\n\n\u201cLean and safety are linked heavily,\u201d she said. \u201cVisual management of your workplace is probably the easiest, quickest win for lean manufacturing. [Floor marking and signs](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/linking-lean-and-visuals/) have been especially helpful for safety. For example, having a yellow marked tape underneath a fire extinguisher means no one can block it and that it is fully accessible during an emergency. When you walk out onto the Ghirardelli factory floor, you will see many tool shadow boards with engraved tools and 5S checklists for operators to make sure all equipment and tools are in place and all equipment is marked with colored tape.\u201d\n\nTan says she believes 5S is the best investment of everyone\u2019s time, not just at Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Her advice to other manufacturers?\n\n\u201cChange takes a while,\u201d she says. \u201cYour job as a lean proponent is to show everyone why this change is important for them: Why should they care about lean? Why should they care about reducing losses in their plant? Because it makes their job easier\u2014less cleaning time, less breakdowns, and less risk for their safety.\u201d",

I work at a large manufacturing company with presence in 3 states. Of the 3 shops, I'm the only CNC machinist and responsible for machining tooling for all 3 factories. I've been here a few years and just recently found out my official title in the company is \"CNC Machine Operator\" Yet my workload doesn't reflect that title. When asked for a raise, I was told that they are competitive with the job title in the area. I also have a family member that's a CNC machine oparator (100% button pusher) and makes more a year than I do for a smaller company.\n\nNow before you say, \"Why don't you go work there?\" Yes, I'm thinking of putting a resume in over there, but before I do, I wanted to sit down with my employer and see if we can't first come to a mutual agreement. Here's a break down of what I currently do:\n\nOnly CNC Machinist. In charge of one 3-axis mill and lathe. Also one manual mill and lathe.\n\nI do all the programming for both, and setups for both. 2D and 3D toolpaths daily.\n\nMultiple set-up's a day on both machines.\n\nIn charge of ordering tools, material, parts to complete assemblies.\n\nCommunicate directly with outsourcing vendors.\n\nFix/amend incorrect prints (we have an engineer at the same plant, but doesn't know what GD&T is).\n\nMachine upkeep.\n\nInventory control of all parts made.\n\nShipping parts to other factories.\n\nCommunicate with other factories for expedited parts, one off parts, emergency parts needed.\n\nI used to work in another larger machine shop and there were multiple people who did the above workload, and I was able to just program, setup and run.\n\nI also have talked with other employees and they have mentioned that they have had a machinist in the past only last a few months before leaving, So I've got that I can work with as well.\n\nI was thinking that I should at least be titled at least as a Senior CNC Programmer, but is there something else that might be a better fit for the jobs I do daily?\n\nWhat say you Reddit?",

        "content": "Modes of manufacturing: OEM, ODM and OBM. What do all these letters mean?\nHave you ever dream about making something? A product, a toy, a machine, something you thought would be fun or useful. Since a lot of the manufacturing has been happening in China, chances are you would work with a Chinese factory to make your dream into reality. But how would you start? Deciding on how would you work with the factories would be one. In general, there are 3 modes of working with a factory, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), original design manufacturer (ODM) and original brand manufacturer (OBM).\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) is the mode that factory has zero or very little involvement in product development. Instead, it provides the production facility and labor to get the product produced based on design provided by the clients. Given that, the factory does not have a lot of room for profit. Fewer and fewer factories in China are engaging in services like that given the increasing labor cost. I was paid with \uffe510 ($1.4 dollars at the time) for a day when i first started at 14, now the labor cost in Shenzhen is about $5 dollars an hour. It\u2019s not quite an apples for apples comparison because I was young and labor cost was cheaper in inner part of mainland China. It\u2019s easier and financially wise to get products made in places where labor costs are lower.\n\nAs the engineering capability of the factory grows, it starts to get involved with product development. That is called an original design manufacturer (ODM). Depending on its involvement with product design, factory charges varying amount of non-recurring engineering (NRE) for the product, in addition to the sampling, testing, certification, etc. costs throughout the product development stages. The line between OEM and ODM is not always clear, as the best way to make product is usually involves inputs from the factories, they are best people to know how to optimize product design to make it easier to assemble. For example, the way Foxconn works with Apple would be a combination of OEM and ODM. Most headphones are developed based on the ODM model. \n\nA factory will often strive to become an original brand manufacturer (OBM), design and build products under a brand name they own. This gives them better margin and more control over the business. Other than developing the product on its own, factory would also managing the marketing and sales of the product. It\u2019s like the top of the game in manufacturing and very few players are able to get there. Huawei is one of them. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for larger client companies to source the same product from multiple different factories and move the quantity ordered around based on cost and quality. Obviously the threat that the order might be placed to your competitor instead of you is something keeps a factory on its toes. In theory it sounds good, but in practice it will damage the relationship between clients and factories if orders don\u2019t come after the effort has been put in to get the product ready from production. It will also discourage a factory put in extra effort to develop and improve the company\u2019s products in the future. Everything has a cost, and if you push factories to cut down to a lower price you are likely to pay for it in lower quality or higher quotes for future products. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts about this week\u2019s piece or particular thing around manufacturing you would like to know. Next week, I\u2019ll share how products get developed. What process does it go through before hitting the market?",

        "content": "How is a factory organized?\n The idea of a factory used to be a magical place for me. The first time I learned about it was from my cousins when I was still in elementary school. They were home for Chinese New Year from the factory they\u2019re working at and talking about their life there by the dinner table. \n\nMy cousins, as well as many of the migrant workers in our village, were dropouts or graduates of middle school. Going to work for a factory afterwards was the mainstream path for them. The correlation between a better education and a better paying job later was too distant for many parents and students. Earning money to keep food on the table and a roof over head was far more urgent. \n\nAnd a factory was the place that made it happen. Over time, all of my cousin\u2019s and villager\u2019s families were able to afford better standard of living. I was a bit amazed to see that even with a middle school education or less, you could go work at a factory and earn a decent living in our village. It\u2019s the place everyone could go and make a better life for themselves. \n\nBut how does a factory is organized? How does it work? I had no idea until I started working at one many years later. \n\nFactories vary in sizes and the products they are making. However, any factory, regardless of its size or field should have following personal/team/department serves these functions. \n\n1) Sales. They\u2019re the first line of people you may interact with if you wish you establish a business relationship with a factory. You may find then on Alibaba.com or various trade shows. A preferred way is through connections. Ask whoever you know is already working with factories and ask them, or their connections to recommend factories they trust. It\u2019s the approach that could save you many bumps on the road if you fumble on your own.\n\nBe mindful that some of sales people you talk to may not work for a factory. Instead, they work for a middle-man company that sources the products from factories and resell to you at a profit. Like other things in life, having a middle-man in between sometimes could be the recipe for miscommunication, taking longer to get things done and surely cost you more. I\u2019d recommend you try to work with a factory directly, as its advantages almost ways outweighs its drudgery.\n\n2) Engineering. If you are just sourcing an off-shelf product from the factory, you may have very little interaction with its engineering team. However, if you like to source something unique and have the factory customizes for you , chances are you would be having quite a lot discussions & meetings with the engineering team to make sure the design is manufacturable.  \n\nThere is an iron triangle in the manufacturing world. That is, cost, quality and time. A design may looks great and unique, however it may costs many times more than your budget to have it mass produced. Or, if you are not willing to pay more, chances are quality of the product are going to be reduced at a longer lead time. Be prepared to make compromises on your product design to reach the sweet spot of best cost, quality and time. Before doing so, seize every opportunity to educate yourself different aspects of the production process so you know when to push back and where to make compromises. \n\nA factory may charge NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) for the amount of engineering work they\u2019re expected to do. The basic calculation of NRE is the number of engineering members, plus the length of time, times by their labor costs. \n\nThe factory may also present samples during engineering development stage at additional cost. Depending on the type of products, you may ask for non-working samples (mechanical demonstration of the design), working samples (demonstration of all or most of the performing features) or even color samples (color matches your spec) and more. The quantity and types of samples are negotiable.\n\n3) Production. It is usually the largest department in any given factory and its role is to scale up production once the engineering team has finished their development/validation. Ask how many production lines the factory has and yield rates of them, to help yourself run estimates of how much time would it take to get what you plan to order. \n\n4) Quality. Needless to say, it is the team that manages quality of the products. To access a factory\u2019s capability to manage its product quality, you may start with asking questions like how a certain product should be tested to understand its reliability. If the factory has been making that type of products, they should be able to produce a reliability testing plan with detailed testing standards.\n\nOr, when you have a chance to visit the factory, pay attention to if what you were told matches with what you are seeing on the site. For example, if defective parts on the production line are being isolated as they supposed to be? Or ask to see records of IQC (Incoming Quality Control) to see if it matches with whatever process it should follow through. \n\n5) Sourcing. The factory I work at source headphone parts from our partners, so that we can do its assembly and packing. The partners we work with source raw materials from their supply chain so that they can deliver the parts to us. Regardless of its size, any factory will need to source something for its production. That something could be a tangible component, a production process, or intangible licenses to program into the products.\n\nHow a factory manage its sourcing could potentially affects the final product costs and quality. If opportunities allows, try to understand what is the sourcing team\u2019s approach to get the best price in the market? And how do they manage the supply risk of a high-demand or critical part? \n\n6) Importing, exporting and finance. The size of the factory determines the number of people working on these teams. You may have little transaction with them as they are not directly relating to the production of the products. \n\n7) HR and administration. Yeah, they are the ones working behind the scene and mostly serving for the people working at the factory. This may sound strange to you, but most of the factories have canteen, dorms and sometimes even library, ATM machine, or convenience store etc. for its employees. The unique thing about a Chinese factory is that it could function like a closed-community and workers may not have to step outside the gate to get everything they need. \n\nI wonder whoever had factories designed that way shares the same mentality as the ones designed casinos? The results seem to suggest they\u2019ve arrived at the same destination, where both factory workers and gamblers are all sitting happily in the space they\u2019re designed to be days, weeks or even months on end. \n\nThat\u2019s a basic layout of how a factory is organized. I hope it helped to answer some of the questions you might have. I\u2019d like to remind you pay particular attention to those teams of a factory after you\u2019ve gone through the sales and like to know more about it through in-depth discussion or a visit. It is the performance of their job determines the quality of the product/service you\u2019ll be getting. \n\nNext week, I plan to share the differences among factories run by Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Konger, mainlander, etc. All of them had their factories set up in mainland China but run it with different approaches. It is interesting to observe the differences in culture and ways of working.",

Topic overviews would cover material considerations, different manufacturing processes, basic history, why different countries seem to focus on different categories of manufacturing for the export market (textiles v automotive v electronics), optimization and DFM, Quality Control methodology, outsourcing considerations, basics of logistics, rapid prototyping, etc...\n\nAlso, any that might be good candidates for a team book club.\n\nSorry if this just an insanely broad question. An example of what I personally found helpful are Paul Midler\u2019s books and posts on manufacturing in China.\n\nEDIT: I guess to refine this a bit more, my primary need would be for a survey style overview of the manufacturing industry, i.e. how are some common products made (furniture, textiles, electronics, appliances), what are the most common manufacturing methods (PIM, CNC, Vacuum forming, casting, etc...) and why is manufacturing often outsourced rather than kept domestic?",

So ill start with a bit of that and see where that leads.  \nPart price is based on materials and qty to be made.  10 parts are expensive due to setup and overhead, paying for idle time etc.  The very same part made the same way but 1000 of them drop a lot in cost just due to reduced shop overhead costs per part.  As you move thru 10000 to 100000 parts you need to redesign the part and process to keep getting economy of scale.  Doubling up front engineering costs may make a better part that can switch mfg strategy for cheaper high volume production.  For cnc it may be moving from milling from a block of material to a rotary transfer machine or to a casting with just a few machined surfaces.  \nSome probable reasons for overseas might be little to no regulation overhead and, cheaper labor costs.  \nMfg methods are varied by industry.  The show how its made touches on many.  I think it might be on YouTube.  \nSome methods use extrusion, casting, injection molding,  milling, turning, welding, sheet metal forming.  And that is just basic metal and plastic methods.   \nA bit haphazard, but that help fill anything in?",

We develop and manufacture robotic systems in-house for the biotech industry.\n\nI'm quite inexperienced - I have had some internships at for example a Volvo factory and an electronic product manufacturer handling stuff like BOM's and optimizing parts of existing manufacturing systems, but we're basically starting from scratch.\n\nI've been reading up on lean practices a lot, investigated ERP system solutions (primarily Katana MRP and Odoo) and I'm currently in the process of trying to set up some excel-based information systems to get a better understanding of everything that needs to happen and to have a basic system we can develop further.\n\nOur product has approximately 125 unique components excluding fasteners and cables. It's primarily 3d printed structural components, some laser cut acrylic components, some laser cut stainless steel, a bunch of off the shelf parts we get from various major component suppliers in the EU/US and various off the shelf or slightly customized parts from China.\n\nOne of the most fundamental things I'm not sure how to do properly is keeping inventory/handling purchasing. We're currently scaling up from one prototype to 4-5, and just handling this initial surge is a bit overwhelming currently.\n\nI think I'm basically just looking for any guidance, advice on books to read or videos to watch or examples of good systems that are suitable for a company at this stage.\n\nThanks!",

                "content": "Am in the medical devices sector.\n\nAs per CE regulation (since you are doing biotech stuff, I assume it applies), you might have to keep a paper trail of everything you produce, with lot numbers and all, so that's that. With this comes a complete company wide process mapping effort (from R&D to purchasing to assembly to inventory to shipping). You may also have to qualify your supplier, which means looking under the hood at their process and so forth - always interesting and will help you understand how you could/should operate.\n\nYou can manage the BOM within Excel, for each final, assembled product. Not so convenient I know, but it does the job and works as long as there is only a single user (typically its owner). It would be foolish for you to expect an ERP system to help you solve your problems, because ERPs are supposed to be tailored to **your** processes and you do not know what they are, and will not know for a while. Manage each batch of assembled produce via a folder structure (leafs are subcomponents), and maintain the entirety of the manufacturing data in it (delivery notes, material certificates, purchase orders \\[including the drawings used at the time the order was placed\\], inspection sheets & non-conforming issues etc...). And yes, if you can and have the patience, duplicate this with a paper trail (this will work better if you are audited or are seeking ISO 13485 certification).\n\nJust think about it from this standpoint: you should be able to navigate top-down (from your finished product to individual subcomponent) and bottom-up (from individual subcomponent to the finished product) the hierarchy of parts to isolate a bad batch, a bad supplier or a bad design.\n\nExpect your product to change, if not because of your customers, at least because of your own ignorance. Another nightmare is to keep track of which parts work with which other part through these changes. One of the requirements of the MDD directive is to laser etch a lot number on the part, and we managed to tag on and squeeze in an additional number that would allow us to map compatibility only by looking at a component.\n\nIf you are a startup with or without funding, dig around your network, alumni, and get someone onboard (offer him shares if needed) who has experience in manufacturing/outsourcing and who can walk you through this. Even hire a consultant (he may use up to 1-3 days / month, so not cost that much in the end), because there are super costly mistakes that are waiting for you.\n\nPS: On the financial side, anticipate that about 1/3 to 1/2 of your turn over will go to subcontractors. Only difference is that you will have to pay them long before you sell the products so this might stretch you super thin between inventory and sales, just factor this in before your see you capital balloon during inventory buildup before assembly.",

That\u2019s heavily thanks to the company\u2019s culture of zero losses and a steadfast commitment to lean, according to Helen Tan, lean manufacturing engineer at the Bay Area chocolatier\u2019s manufacturing facility. Even with intense pressures to produce enough delicious confections in time for holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas, production must follow a solid plan that\u2019s been integral to the [Ghirardelli brand](https://www.ghirardelli.com/)\u2019s foundation.\n\n## Strong Foundation\n\nSince 1852, Ghirardelli has set itself apart from other chocolate manufacturers by branding its quality and centralizing its capacity. Through modern improvements to its traditional chocolate-making process, the company (part of Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli AG) thrives among the [top chocolatiers in the world](https://www.icco.org/about-cocoa/chocolate-industry.html).\n\nAn official San Francisco landmark, the famous Ghirardelli illuminated light bulb sign is visible for miles. It is a welcome sight to air travelers and ships passing through the Golden Gate Strait. A popular tourist destination, Ghirardelli Square delights visitors with intimate views of the chocolate-making process, which is set inside a large Victorian-style complex blocks from San Francisco Bay. Huge sacks of raw cocoa beans come in from throughout the world, which are processed into nibs before entering a liquefied chocolate format.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChocolate is very fickle,\u201d Tan said, whose favorite is Ghirardelli\u2019s dark chocolate Sea Salt Soiree. \u201cWe need to be careful with how we temper it to produce the best crystalline structure and reduce any defects downstream.\u201d\n\nAs an industrial performance engineer, Tan leads the facility\u2019s [Total Productive Maintenance program](https://www.graphicproducts.com/infographics/pillars-of-tpm/). \u201cWe try to instill a culture of zero losses, engaging 100% of the workforce, and empowering them to own their respective factory equipment and brainstorm solutions to problems on the shop floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBy instilling a lean culture, we hope that Ghirardelli transforms to a state of pure Zen\u2014happy machines and happy workers.\u201d\n\n## Lean Essentials\n\nPart of Ghirardelli\u2019s lean master plan to reduce losses and breakdown time includes designated teams, one of which that focuses on improving [tools for 5S](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/tools-for-5s/). Tan says besides having smooth production lines and tools in their proper place, operators are engaged and looking out for hazards and risks. Improvements in the process and re-training are common solutions for worker safety.\n\n\u201cLean and safety are linked heavily,\u201d she said. \u201cVisual management of your workplace is probably the easiest, quickest win for lean manufacturing. [Floor marking and signs](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/linking-lean-and-visuals/) have been especially helpful for safety. For example, having a yellow marked tape underneath a fire extinguisher means no one can block it and that it is fully accessible during an emergency. When you walk out onto the Ghirardelli factory floor, you will see many tool shadow boards with engraved tools and 5S checklists for operators to make sure all equipment and tools are in place and all equipment is marked with colored tape.\u201d\n\nTan says she believes 5S is the best investment of everyone\u2019s time, not just at Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Her advice to other manufacturers?\n\n\u201cChange takes a while,\u201d she says. \u201cYour job as a lean proponent is to show everyone why this change is important for them: Why should they care about lean? Why should they care about reducing losses in their plant? Because it makes their job easier\u2014less cleaning time, less breakdowns, and less risk for their safety.\u201d",

Lean and Six Sigma are great tools, without question.  Their limitations rest in the fact they are based on **behavioral controls**.

Full achievement has been difficult until the introduction of **iIoT - industrial Internet of Things.**  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nConnecting physical hardware to cyber-systems is in the process of driving a true **mistake-proof** **Lean**, **Zero Defect Manufacturing** process that ensure *technical controls* (processes controlled and checked by sensors) overcome the limitations of *behavioral controls* (such as, untrained operators attempting the process, someone distracted or someone hungover).  \n  \nThe question:  Where to start?  \n  \nThe answer:  Click below\n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nOther sources of information:  \n  \n- [Mckinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/manufacturings-next-act)  \n  \n- [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/industry-4.0/what-we-mean.html)  \n  \n- [Automation Alley](https://zerodefectmanufacturing.com/ujigami-mes)  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nI'm happy to answer any questions.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nEdit:  For transparency, I'm not directly affiliated to any of the above links, I'm a member of Automation Alley but pay to be one because I believe in their message.",

My primary responsibility was really to learn about Manufacturing and business in general (my degree is not in business) and to get out on the shop floor and just try to make improvements.  \n\nOur lean implementation model at the time was terrible so the first 6 months was very much a wash as far as impact goes but I learned a lot.  \n\nSo after showing motivation and willingness I took a promotion to be a lean manager in one of our facilities full time.  Six months out of the army and still very confused as to what Lean was I took the job and got to work.  \n\nOur production lead time at the time was 3 months from raw material to finished good.  We were the traditional batch and queue plant.  I remember to this day walking through the plant with our company sensei telling him \u201cwe can\u2019t flow the product because it\u2019s too big and we have to batch our sub assemblies because it\u2019s more efficient\u201d !\n\nSo after a year of running continuous improvement initiatives we in hindsight luckily had focused on material flow the entire time!  Certainly was not deliberate we just got lucky.  It enabled us to stop batch and queue and focus on flow. We cut lead time from 3 months to 26 days.  It was incredible!\n\nThe luck of that year and a half earned me a promotion to run our new transformation system for 5 plants and build a team of 5 transformation managers under me (1 for each facility).  With our new system that I am responsible for launching it is an amazing feeling conducting Value Stream Analysis and running and enabling kaizen events. \n\nI\u2019ve grown in 3.5 years, have had countless impact on the company and had a blast building a team that now runs their own kaizen events regularly.  We\u2019ve started expanding kaizen to sales, supply chain, NPD,  etc .\n\nI firmly believe Lean implementations need a fully funded and supported business system led from the top down. It certainly is a blast!\n",

Very few outsiders. We also specialize in undesirable employees. Such as people in rehab houses, ex cons PTSD sufferers, people really down on their luck. We take these people into our family and we try to help them help theirselves. The other employees make sure they have lunch we call and check on them if they are late. We share our own hard luck experiences with them on breaks. We give advice. We have two women whose husbands have terminal cancer. We employ a lot of well past retirement people also. With 12 people in the dept we need everyone but they both have to take extended time off and we all just work around it. It takes a lot to get fired, if you can't do a job you are just sent to every position until you can do something. We have even helped other employees go to rehab when they start showing signs of an addiction. So I wanna know if this is how most factories are because I have never worked anywhere else.",

And rest are rental workers, like I was, who at best are kept around or stay around for an year or two. No one asks, cares, or wants to hear about your private life. Other than those few old dudes, in the break room no one wants to talk. In one factory, they actually didn't even put the lights on during the break so people could take a quick nap.    \n\n\nIt isn't uncommon to stay a year somewhere, and never learn the names of the people you work with. Hell... it is common to not even have a common language. The dude in the next welding unit might only speak Russian, or Polish. You won't know. Only way to get to know people is to take smoke breaks, that is usually where people do at least basic chatting.  \n\n\nSince rental work is so common, at least here. Being late, not being productive, or having issues is grounds for not getting your order continues. It isn't the same as being fired, because you don't work for the company where you work at, you work for the rental agency. This has it's benefits. Like being able to get out of a contract quickly and there are no downsides to it, and you are never tied to the contract. If you find a better paid job or otherwise better job, like I did few times, I could basically leave with a days notice.  \n\n\nBut what you got there, sounds totally unique.",

If it is a profitable and small niche business with few competitors, then such a community/employee friendly business can be sustained.\n\nAs you get into highly competitive markets, productivity and cost become too important. Unproductive employees are dropped. Waste is eliminated in all areas. Automation, where cost effective, is heavily used. Outsourcing work to foreign markets is a matter of course. If your company doesn't do this, then they get easily out-competed by a company who does and they lose the business. \n\nIt makes sense - company A provides a part at 60 cents, company B provides the same exact part at 45 cents because they have no waste to pay for.

Not so much necessarily on the \"undesirables\" thing but once you're \"in\" the company really does it's best to make sure you succeed.

The number or people who retire from here with 35+ plus years is unreal, plus the ones that have been here for 20+ and will be here until the end. The company really does it's best to accommodate those who end up needing special or limited hours because of injury or illness. It is a small, family owned steel fab shop with 75-100 employees. I think some of the biggest factors that keep people here are that the owners work in and on the business, company events (small stuff like bowling, annual golf tournament, very nice Christmas party, ect) and the pay. \n\nThey don't pay a lot hourly, supposedly to keep things lean and us nimble with cash flow, BUT they more than make up for it in bonuses. I think how they pay makes employees focus on the bottom line big time! I made 6 figures last year where half was from my hourly and half was in the form of bonuses. Most companies would be happy to pay their people maybe $50-60k and then the owners make millions. On top of all that they do a small 401k match and STILL have their own profit sharing plan where employees are fully vested after about 7 years.",

People will be unwilling to point out violations if they're not sure if this is the one that's getting their buddy fired.\n\nI think what your looking to get to is some continuous improvement program. For that I found that making it a game can work. Make a chart of each employee in a section and post it somewhere where everyone can see. Then every time someone reports an \"observable\" give them a sticker, a gold star, red dot, whatever so that you can keep score. Then at the end of every month the one with the most dots wins something, a gift card, a hat, something. It will be slow at first but competition will build especially if the prize is good. Then every month set a minimum just to qualify. If you have consistent winners in groups mix up the teams and put the high performers together. They are your safety champions now and you can groom them to keep an eye out.\n\nThe observeables don't have to name names, just situations and results. \"saw employee without safety glasses. Reminded them to wear them and they put them on.' Bang, done. Don't turn people into snitches. If you start to see a bunch of the same kind that are low hanging fruit, up the bar and disallow the type, or disallow it for the high reporters.\n\nIts hard to do and YMMV but with by keeping it positive and \"fun\" you can move things around pretty fast.",

        "content": "Ghirardelli's Secret Recipe: Staying Lean\nBy Christine Torres  \n\n\nGhirardelli Chocolate Company prides itself as a smooth operator. That\u2019s heavily thanks to the company\u2019s culture of zero losses and a steadfast commitment to lean, according to Helen Tan, lean manufacturing engineer at the Bay Area chocolatier\u2019s manufacturing facility. Even with intense pressures to produce enough delicious confections in time for holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas, production must follow a solid plan that\u2019s been integral to the [Ghirardelli brand](https://www.ghirardelli.com/)\u2019s foundation.\n\n## Strong Foundation\n\nSince 1852, Ghirardelli has set itself apart from other chocolate manufacturers by branding its quality and centralizing its capacity. Through modern improvements to its traditional chocolate-making process, the company (part of Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli AG) thrives among the [top chocolatiers in the world](https://www.icco.org/about-cocoa/chocolate-industry.html).\n\nAn official San Francisco landmark, the famous Ghirardelli illuminated light bulb sign is visible for miles. It is a welcome sight to air travelers and ships passing through the Golden Gate Strait. A popular tourist destination, Ghirardelli Square delights visitors with intimate views of the chocolate-making process, which is set inside a large Victorian-style complex blocks from San Francisco Bay. Huge sacks of raw cocoa beans come in from throughout the world, which are processed into nibs before entering a liquefied chocolate format.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChocolate is very fickle,\u201d Tan said, whose favorite is Ghirardelli\u2019s dark chocolate Sea Salt Soiree. \u201cWe need to be careful with how we temper it to produce the best crystalline structure and reduce any defects downstream.\u201d\n\nAs an industrial performance engineer, Tan leads the facility\u2019s [Total Productive Maintenance program](https://www.graphicproducts.com/infographics/pillars-of-tpm/). \u201cWe try to instill a culture of zero losses, engaging 100% of the workforce, and empowering them to own their respective factory equipment and brainstorm solutions to problems on the shop floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBy instilling a lean culture, we hope that Ghirardelli transforms to a state of pure Zen\u2014happy machines and happy workers.\u201d\n\n## Lean Essentials\n\nPart of Ghirardelli\u2019s lean master plan to reduce losses and breakdown time includes designated teams, one of which that focuses on improving [tools for 5S](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/tools-for-5s/). Tan says besides having smooth production lines and tools in their proper place, operators are engaged and looking out for hazards and risks. Improvements in the process and re-training are common solutions for worker safety.\n\n\u201cLean and safety are linked heavily,\u201d she said. \u201cVisual management of your workplace is probably the easiest, quickest win for lean manufacturing. [Floor marking and signs](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/linking-lean-and-visuals/) have been especially helpful for safety. For example, having a yellow marked tape underneath a fire extinguisher means no one can block it and that it is fully accessible during an emergency. When you walk out onto the Ghirardelli factory floor, you will see many tool shadow boards with engraved tools and 5S checklists for operators to make sure all equipment and tools are in place and all equipment is marked with colored tape.\u201d\n\nTan says she believes 5S is the best investment of everyone\u2019s time, not just at Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Her advice to other manufacturers?\n\n\u201cChange takes a while,\u201d she says. \u201cYour job as a lean proponent is to show everyone why this change is important for them: Why should they care about lean? Why should they care about reducing losses in their plant? Because it makes their job easier\u2014less cleaning time, less breakdowns, and less risk for their safety.\u201d",

Very few outsiders. We also specialize in undesirable employees. Such as people in rehab houses, ex cons PTSD sufferers, people really down on their luck. We take these people into our family and we try to help them help theirselves. The other employees make sure they have lunch we call and check on them if they are late. We share our own hard luck experiences with them on breaks. We give advice. We have two women whose husbands have terminal cancer. We employ a lot of well past retirement people also. With 12 people in the dept we need everyone but they both have to take extended time off and we all just work around it. It takes a lot to get fired, if you can't do a job you are just sent to every position until you can do something. We have even helped other employees go to rehab when they start showing signs of an addiction. So I wanna know if this is how most factories are because I have never worked anywhere else.",

Other than those few old dudes, in the break room no one wants to talk. In one factory, they actually didn't even put the lights on during the break so people could take a quick nap.    \n\n\nIt isn't uncommon to stay a year somewhere, and never learn the names of the people you work with. Hell... it is common to not even have a common language. The dude in the next welding unit might only speak Russian, or Polish. You won't know. Only way to get to know people is to take smoke breaks, that is usually where people do at least basic chatting.  \n\n\nSince rental work is so common, at least here. Being late, not being productive, or having issues is grounds for not getting your order continues. It isn't the same as being fired, because you don't work for the company where you work at, you work for the rental agency. This has it's benefits. Like being able to get out of a contract quickly and there are no downsides to it, and you are never tied to the contract. If you find a better paid job or otherwise better job, like I did few times, I could basically leave with a days notice.  \n\n\nBut what you got there, sounds totally unique.",

Unproductive employees are dropped. Waste is eliminated in all areas. Automation, where cost effective, is heavily used. Outsourcing work to foreign markets is a matter of course. If your company doesn't do this, then they get easily out-competed by a company who does and they lose the business. \n\nIt makes sense - company A provides a part at 60 cents, company B provides the same exact part at 45 cents because they have no waste to pay for.

The number or people who retire from here with 35+ plus years is unreal, plus the ones that have been here for 20+ and will be here until the end. The company really does it's best to accommodate those who end up needing special or limited hours because of injury or illness. It is a small, family owned steel fab shop with 75-100 employees. I think some of the biggest factors that keep people here are that the owners work in and on the business, company events (small stuff like bowling, annual golf tournament, very nice Christmas party, ect) and the pay. \n\nThey don't pay a lot hourly, supposedly to keep things lean and us nimble with cash flow, BUT they more than make up for it in bonuses. I think how they pay makes employees focus on the bottom line big time! I made 6 figures last year where half was from my hourly and half was in the form of bonuses. Most companies would be happy to pay their people maybe $50-60k and then the owners make millions. On top of all that they do a small 401k match and STILL have their own profit sharing plan where employees are fully vested after about 7 years.",

People will be unwilling to point out violations if they're not sure if this is the one that's getting their buddy fired.\n\nI think what your looking to get to is some continuous improvement program. For that I found that making it a game can work. Make a chart of each employee in a section and post it somewhere where everyone can see. Then every time someone reports an \"observable\" give them a sticker, a gold star, red dot, whatever so that you can keep score. Then at the end of every month the one with the most dots wins something, a gift card, a hat, something. It will be slow at first but competition will build especially if the prize is good. Then every month set a minimum just to qualify. If you have consistent winners in groups mix up the teams and put the high performers together. They are your safety champions now and you can groom them to keep an eye out.\n\nThe observeables don't have to name names, just situations and results. \"saw employee without safety glasses. Reminded them to wear them and they put them on.' Bang, done. Don't turn people into snitches. If you start to see a bunch of the same kind that are low hanging fruit, up the bar and disallow the type, or disallow it for the high reporters.\n\nIts hard to do and YMMV but with by keeping it positive and \"fun\" you can move things around pretty fast.",

        "content": "Ghirardelli's Secret Recipe: Staying Lean\nBy Christine Torres  \n\n\nGhirardelli Chocolate Company prides itself as a smooth operator. That\u2019s heavily thanks to the company\u2019s culture of zero losses and a steadfast commitment to lean, according to Helen Tan, lean manufacturing engineer at the Bay Area chocolatier\u2019s manufacturing facility. Even with intense pressures to produce enough delicious confections in time for holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas, production must follow a solid plan that\u2019s been integral to the [Ghirardelli brand](https://www.ghirardelli.com/)\u2019s foundation.\n\n## Strong Foundation\n\nSince 1852, Ghirardelli has set itself apart from other chocolate manufacturers by branding its quality and centralizing its capacity. Through modern improvements to its traditional chocolate-making process, the company (part of Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli AG) thrives among the [top chocolatiers in the world](https://www.icco.org/about-cocoa/chocolate-industry.html).\n\nAn official San Francisco landmark, the famous Ghirardelli illuminated light bulb sign is visible for miles. It is a welcome sight to air travelers and ships passing through the Golden Gate Strait. A popular tourist destination, Ghirardelli Square delights visitors with intimate views of the chocolate-making process, which is set inside a large Victorian-style complex blocks from San Francisco Bay. Huge sacks of raw cocoa beans come in from throughout the world, which are processed into nibs before entering a liquefied chocolate format.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChocolate is very fickle,\u201d Tan said, whose favorite is Ghirardelli\u2019s dark chocolate Sea Salt Soiree. \u201cWe need to be careful with how we temper it to produce the best crystalline structure and reduce any defects downstream.\u201d\n\nAs an industrial performance engineer, Tan leads the facility\u2019s [Total Productive Maintenance program](https://www.graphicproducts.com/infographics/pillars-of-tpm/). \u201cWe try to instill a culture of zero losses, engaging 100% of the workforce, and empowering them to own their respective factory equipment and brainstorm solutions to problems on the shop floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBy instilling a lean culture, we hope that Ghirardelli transforms to a state of pure Zen\u2014happy machines and happy workers.\u201d\n\n## Lean Essentials\n\nPart of Ghirardelli\u2019s lean master plan to reduce losses and breakdown time includes designated teams, one of which that focuses on improving [tools for 5S](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/tools-for-5s/). Tan says besides having smooth production lines and tools in their proper place, operators are engaged and looking out for hazards and risks. Improvements in the process and re-training are common solutions for worker safety.\n\n\u201cLean and safety are linked heavily,\u201d she said. \u201cVisual management of your workplace is probably the easiest, quickest win for lean manufacturing. [Floor marking and signs](https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/linking-lean-and-visuals/) have been especially helpful for safety. For example, having a yellow marked tape underneath a fire extinguisher means no one can block it and that it is fully accessible during an emergency. When you walk out onto the Ghirardelli factory floor, you will see many tool shadow boards with engraved tools and 5S checklists for operators to make sure all equipment and tools are in place and all equipment is marked with colored tape.\u201d\n\nTan says she believes 5S is the best investment of everyone\u2019s time, not just at Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Her advice to other manufacturers?\n\n\u201cChange takes a while,\u201d she says. \u201cYour job as a lean proponent is to show everyone why this change is important for them: Why should they care about lean? Why should they care about reducing losses in their plant? Because it makes their job easier\u2014less cleaning time, less breakdowns, and less risk for their safety.\u201d",

        "content": "A new manufacturing process for bottled water?\nHi good people of reddit\n\nI have a question about the technology in manufacturing.\n\nSo, I have a factory that processes natural water; cleans it, and fills the bottles, packs them onto pallets, and moves into a truck. Pretty straight forward and standard for a factory. There is a need for about 10 people per shift to operate everything.\n\nThe problem that I have is that in this country where the factory is, there is a huge emigration problem that came to be several years ago. There is basically nobody to employ. Now, the factory is currently frozen as there is nobody to work in it, so in this age of computers and robotics am forced to seek a different solution. \n\nIt's very hard for me to even comprehend what is available out there at the moment. Is there a robot that can replace the human hand here? Possibly to automate the entire process? I don't reject the idea that there is still something that a robot cannot do, but the further this can be automated, the better. \n\nI am trying to find some existing tech available out there but I have a feeling I am even having hard time with keywords hence my presence here on reddit. \n\nAny good info here might be good enough to save the company. \n\nI thank everyone in advance.",

        "content": "How is a factory organized?\n The idea of a factory used to be a magical place for me. The first time I learned about it was from my cousins when I was still in elementary school. They were home for Chinese New Year from the factory they\u2019re working at and talking about their life there by the dinner table. \n\nMy cousins, as well as many of the migrant workers in our village, were dropouts or graduates of middle school. Going to work for a factory afterwards was the mainstream path for them. The correlation between a better education and a better paying job later was too distant for many parents and students. Earning money to keep food on the table and a roof over head was far more urgent. \n\nAnd a factory was the place that made it happen. Over time, all of my cousin\u2019s and villager\u2019s families were able to afford better standard of living. I was a bit amazed to see that even with a middle school education or less, you could go work at a factory and earn a decent living in our village. It\u2019s the place everyone could go and make a better life for themselves. \n\nBut how does a factory is organized? How does it work? I had no idea until I started working at one many years later. \n\nFactories vary in sizes and the products they are making. However, any factory, regardless of its size or field should have following personal/team/department serves these functions. \n\n1) Sales. They\u2019re the first line of people you may interact with if you wish you establish a business relationship with a factory. You may find then on Alibaba.com or various trade shows. A preferred way is through connections. Ask whoever you know is already working with factories and ask them, or their connections to recommend factories they trust. It\u2019s the approach that could save you many bumps on the road if you fumble on your own.\n\nBe mindful that some of sales people you talk to may not work for a factory. Instead, they work for a middle-man company that sources the products from factories and resell to you at a profit. Like other things in life, having a middle-man in between sometimes could be the recipe for miscommunication, taking longer to get things done and surely cost you more. I\u2019d recommend you try to work with a factory directly, as its advantages almost ways outweighs its drudgery.\n\n2) Engineering. If you are just sourcing an off-shelf product from the factory, you may have very little interaction with its engineering team. However, if you like to source something unique and have the factory customizes for you , chances are you would be having quite a lot discussions & meetings with the engineering team to make sure the design is manufacturable.  \n\nThere is an iron triangle in the manufacturing world. That is, cost, quality and time. A design may looks great and unique, however it may costs many times more than your budget to have it mass produced. Or, if you are not willing to pay more, chances are quality of the product are going to be reduced at a longer lead time. Be prepared to make compromises on your product design to reach the sweet spot of best cost, quality and time. Before doing so, seize every opportunity to educate yourself different aspects of the production process so you know when to push back and where to make compromises. \n\nA factory may charge NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) for the amount of engineering work they\u2019re expected to do. The basic calculation of NRE is the number of engineering members, plus the length of time, times by their labor costs. \n\nThe factory may also present samples during engineering development stage at additional cost. Depending on the type of products, you may ask for non-working samples (mechanical demonstration of the design), working samples (demonstration of all or most of the performing features) or even color samples (color matches your spec) and more. The quantity and types of samples are negotiable.\n\n3) Production. It is usually the largest department in any given factory and its role is to scale up production once the engineering team has finished their development/validation. Ask how many production lines the factory has and yield rates of them, to help yourself run estimates of how much time would it take to get what you plan to order. \n\n4) Quality. Needless to say, it is the team that manages quality of the products. To access a factory\u2019s capability to manage its product quality, you may start with asking questions like how a certain product should be tested to understand its reliability. If the factory has been making that type of products, they should be able to produce a reliability testing plan with detailed testing standards.\n\nOr, when you have a chance to visit the factory, pay attention to if what you were told matches with what you are seeing on the site. For example, if defective parts on the production line are being isolated as they supposed to be? Or ask to see records of IQC (Incoming Quality Control) to see if it matches with whatever process it should follow through. \n\n5) Sourcing. The factory I work at source headphone parts from our partners, so that we can do its assembly and packing. The partners we work with source raw materials from their supply chain so that they can deliver the parts to us. Regardless of its size, any factory will need to source something for its production. That something could be a tangible component, a production process, or intangible licenses to program into the products.\n\nHow a factory manage its sourcing could potentially affects the final product costs and quality. If opportunities allows, try to understand what is the sourcing team\u2019s approach to get the best price in the market? And how do they manage the supply risk of a high-demand or critical part? \n\n6) Importing, exporting and finance. The size of the factory determines the number of people working on these teams. You may have little transaction with them as they are not directly relating to the production of the products. \n\n7) HR and administration. Yeah, they are the ones working behind the scene and mostly serving for the people working at the factory. This may sound strange to you, but most of the factories have canteen, dorms and sometimes even library, ATM machine, or convenience store etc. for its employees. The unique thing about a Chinese factory is that it could function like a closed-community and workers may not have to step outside the gate to get everything they need. \n\nI wonder whoever had factories designed that way shares the same mentality as the ones designed casinos? The results seem to suggest they\u2019ve arrived at the same destination, where both factory workers and gamblers are all sitting happily in the space they\u2019re designed to be days, weeks or even months on end. \n\nThat\u2019s a basic layout of how a factory is organized. I hope it helped to answer some of the questions you might have. I\u2019d like to remind you pay particular attention to those teams of a factory after you\u2019ve gone through the sales and like to know more about it through in-depth discussion or a visit. It is the performance of their job determines the quality of the product/service you\u2019ll be getting. \n\nNext week, I plan to share the differences among factories run by Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Konger, mainlander, etc. All of them had their factories set up in mainland China but run it with different approaches. It is interesting to observe the differences in culture and ways of working.",

A place where multi level production orders that are made-to-order and made-to-stock meet and the whole planning has to deal with constant customer changeovers that affect the long term and the short term production plan.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to do everything on time and in sufficent quality if you have to manually download orders from ERP, create a plan in excel, then print it (or upload the excel to another system for sequencing) and then carry the finished papertrail around the factory. And when you are done a series of changeovers comes, because a bunch of people down the stream ordered something new and want it quickly.\n\nBMW solved this in 2010 by creating one web based system stretched along the planners, line operators, line feeders and expedition and by being very strict with the purity of their data in ERP. \n\nHow are you dealing with these issues in your plants? \n\nDo you use a web based, ERP synced, touch and mobile friendly solution that allows you to have a paperless production planning and scheduling, where adapting to customer changeovers is a matter of drag and dropping an order to a more suitable time slot and the system re-orchestrates everything else based on a preset scenario?\n\nOr even planning the production artificially, where if there is a particular order in the system and a particular material in the supermarket together with a particular raw material in stock, the system just creates a production order without an input from the planner, he\\\\she just confirms and fine-tunes the sequence if any adjustments are needed?\n\nI really like my job, since it is saving tons of money and time and unlocks new potential in manufacturing. \n\nYeah, this is a Saturday blog post from a sales guy, I hope everyone here is having a wonderful weekend.",

        "content": "Parts Picking best practices to prevent errors\nI received many good suggestions from the community here regarding On-Time Delivery and I was hoping for a discussion on how to reduce errors from parts picking.\n\nWe run several high speed liquid filling lines and some expensive mistakes have exposed problems with our picking process. There are 6-12 different components in the bill materials for the typical product we produce. Every component is assigned a 5 or 6 digit part number by R&D prior to its initial receipt, and and all box of components received are tagged with this part number after incoming quality inspection. We see pretty good compliance/quality at this stage.\n\n During changeover into a new product, at startup our line quality tech will verify the part numbers of any components brought to the production line vs the BOM. They will also do this at the start of a new shift, if we are producing the same product with the same BOM. Our production runs on a single BOM can last from 1 hour up to 5 shifts+.\n\nThe biggest mistakes I am seeing are during mid-run when a mistake is made by the material handler who will bring the wrong parts to the line and they are not checked before use. Unfortunately we cannot disassemble based on the nature of our filling (aerosols) so we usually end up scrapping our mistakes. There are a lot of contributing cultural factors that I see driving mistakes:\n\n1. The BOM is not openly visible. It's on the shop floor instructions which sit on a table during the production run. Anyone can go look at it, but it's not up on an electronic board where everyone can see it.  \n2. The vast majority of components are kept in other buildings so people have to travel to get them. This will not change anytime soon. Most of the material handlers will write down on scrap paper what parts they need and then go get them.\n3. We don't have the labor resources to doublecheck parts brought to the line mid-run (and I don't think doublechecking everything is necessarily a good business practice because it avoids correcting what made the mistake happen in the first place) \n4. The specified components are generally in a defined warehouse, but do not have a defined position. This is mainly because we have poor inventory control in the first place, and generally do not have the warehousing capacity for the amount of inventory on hand. Thus we do not have pallet racking with locations defined. If new parts come in we know what warehouse they are supposed to go into but it's up to the forklift driver to organize them. We actually stack a lot of pallets on top of each other with components. We know not to mix component boxes on pallets however. I think this is a complete and total breeding ground for mistakes. We have an MRP where we COULD define locations, but do not.\n5. Many similar components - one with spanish text, one with english text, etc. We do some differentiation of these at incoming receipt with extra colored tagging.\n6. Poor training culture where we just \"throw people at a job\" and hope they stick. This is also slow to change.  \n7. BOMs are constantly changing - they go through a revision process where multiple departments will approve a component change and subsequent part number change, but it's not done electronically. We actually run colored folders around between departments. Usually it doesn't happen quickly enough before the next production run starts, so we will attach a \"temporary change authorization\" document to the work instructions that will say use part X instead of part Y, and then hand-correct the printed BOM. \n\nSince we don't have defined locations, we can't do something like pick-to-light or automating the retrieval system. Other ideas I have seen that we may be able to implement into our current system are RF scanners that have the BOM built into them, so the material handler bringing parts to the line would scan the barcode on the component tag, and then we would have to enforce scanning for every item brought to the line. I'm not sure of the cost of this, or how that would fit in with our constantly changing BOMs. \n\nI guess this turned into a massive vent about the current state of our warehouse management and parts picking. I feel when I started in this position a few years back, we had a real blame culture - try to find out who made the mistake and they would get shunned or scorned by their fellow workers, as opposed to it becoming a teaching moment or opportunity for management to fix what was broken. I think we've made some positive strides and now when mistakes happen, we celebrate that they were caught before the product left our dock. It's taken a hell of a lot of work to get to this point\n\nAny suggestions from your experience, other than \"Find a new place to work\"?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "content": "Different types of factory\n  Factories are not all the same. They have different corporate cultures and ways of working. Read this one to understand differences between a Taiwanese, Japanese and mainlander factory. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\n  In my last piece I talked about the organizations within a factory and things to be aware of when looking for one for your product. Other than that, have you wondered if there are other things set factories apart? Their corporate culture and ways of working, and understanding their differences helps you greatly in working with one. \n\nSince China opened its door to foreign investments in early 1980s, people from all over the world came in and set up their factories in mainland China. These people have brought their unique culture and ways of working into the factories they set up. I\u2019d like to share a few today. \n\n1) Taiwanese factory\n\nAfter a serious of interviews that went nowhere, I finally got a job at a medium-size Taiwanese factory in Dongguan, Guangdong, then manufacturing hub of the world. That was early 2006 and I was 17, away from home for the first time.\n\nI was working as an assistant for the tooling manager. The Job was not demanding but did involve lots of repetitive paper work. It did not take long for me to pick it up and felt comfortable with the role. I started to make friends with girls working at other teams and noticed some of the interesting things at the factory. \n\na. All formal documents were written in traditional Chinese, which was a bit hard to understand for mainland employees as we\u2019re taught the simplified version. Traditional Chinese has been using in Taiwan and the managers brought it over as well.\n\nb. Emphasizing on individual manners was part of the company culture. Everyone at the factory was expected to behave in friendly, gentle tone towards one another. You may think acting with politeness should be the norm. However that\u2019s the only company I worked at that made an emphasis on it. It really helped to keep the positive energy flow among the team.\n\nc. Religious practice had a place at the factory. Just like any mainlanders would go visit the temple or their local Buddha houses on various holidays throughout the year, Taiwanese managers would worship the Buddha they set up at the factory. Religious practice was not new to me, but bringing it into a business facility was. I guess they\u2019re hoping the Buddha would bring prosperous to the factory.\n\nd. Operation of the factory. Like other Taiwanese factories, the one I worked at were operating with the know-how they brought from Taiwan. That included processes & system for production management. As a result, it generally delivers good and consistent quality, at a slightly higher overhead than factories run by mainlanders. \n\nSadly, the factory was closed in 2017 when I looked it up today. Maybe the increase of labor cost in mainland China and more competition with mainlander factories made earning a profit harder for them. \n\n2) Japanese factory \n\nAimed with the English skills and an associate degree I earned while working at the Taiwanese factory, I started looking for new job opportunities. That was 2009, 3 years after working at the former. I became an English translator, later evolved to new product development manager at a sizeable Japanese factory in the same city. The factory was a glasses (eyewear) frame manufacturer. The California-based glasses company Oakley was one of its key clients. I was the one connecting our engineers at the factory and the engineers at Oakley.\n\nNew job at the Japanese factory not only paid more, but offered more benefits as well. To start with, employees were housed better. I no longer needed to share a dorm with 5 other girls. Instead, I lived in a much nicer one bedroom apartment with 2 other girls. Food at the canteen was noticeably better than the last factory as well. \n\nIn addition, the factory also had a library, general store, an ATM machine, standard-sized basketball, football court for all employees. It also went a bit further to care for its people. Other than stationaries, all workers in the office would be given a roll of toilet paper at the beginning of every month. A medical doctor was always available at the doctor\u2019s office within the factory. Basically, all your essential needs could be fulfilled without stepping out of the factory gate.\n\nIn terms of its culture\n\na. One of the best places for fresh graduates to work, thanks to its well established processes & standards for almost everything and dedicated mentors.\n\nb. Off work activities with the team you work with on various occasions were a big part of the company culture. Welcoming a new coworker, farewell someone who was about to be leaving, or festivals throughout the year were all excuses to go out and enjoy a nice meal together. I enjoyed these occasions and felt it was a good way to bond people together and make communications at work easier.\n\nc. Due to the language barrier, instead of appointing Japanese as managers for various teams/department across the factory, these roles were filled by local employees. That allowed more room for them to climb the corporate ladder. Some of them even went as high as senior managers or VPs at the factory, which was unheard of at Taiwanese factories.\n\nAs for operation, Japanese are well-known for their obsession with product quality. However they\u2019re generally a bit conservative when it comes to commit delivery dates. Production may take a bit longer than others, but they mostly do stick to their commitments.\n\nThat factory still runs as of today, however its size has been reduced by more than half. A friend of mine has been working at one of Sony\u2019s factories in China for almost a decade, until it got acquired by a domestic (mainlander) company. I guess the rise of labor cost has affected them as well.\n\n3) Mainlander factory\n\nThat is, a factory set up and run by people from mainland China. It is the most interesting one to me. \n\nDuring my time at the Japanese factory, I earned an undergraduate in Business English. Then, when I was ready to move on, I found a cultural exchange program and moved to the US for a gap year to learn its culture and improve my English. When I came back from the gap year in early 2014, I started working as a project manager for a consumer electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen. It\u2019s a mainlander factory and I am still working there to this day.\n\nPay at the new job is considerably more than my last one, so does its workload and stress. Working in the evenings, or even weekends are expected, to move things faster. The term \u201c996\u201d, that is 9am to 9pm for 6 days a week, has become a hated reality at many mainlander companies in recent years. \n\nOther than longer hours, another thing that sets a mainlander factory apart with other foreign-invested factories is its attitude towards changes. Since most of them has a shorter history than the later and are still in the process of setting up solid processes &system to manage the business, they would not hesitant to change a rule if it does not work well. And they don\u2019t mind to do it frequently either. Translation: working at a mainlander factory sometimes may feel like walking in a jungle and it could be messy!\n\nMainlander factories in general, are able to offer products at lower costs and shorter time. However, it may come with an invisible cost. Depending on the size of the factory and its capabilities, they may not able to manage its production quality effectively. In other words, you as the client may have to step in to help or accept minor defects occasionally.",

                "content": "I run a manufacturing services company located in both USA and China so I started to feel the effects on my production and staff (15 workers) in December of 2019. \n\nAs far as supply chain issues, I would say a lot of the previous factories I worked with switched to manufacturing PPE or couldn't add on a new production run due to short staff- so if I needed a new plastic product manufactured I had to go to another factory or just pay more. The factories that were not producing PPE had raised their prices to adjust for the decline in demand but my clients purchased anyways because it was still more competitive than US or European manufacturing. \n\nAnother big problem is the cost of air freight during Covid. At one point I received a shipping quote for $500,000 for 1 flight. I produce millions of units for a large US home improvement company and they have continued purchasing from us despite the air freight price increase. \n\nIn Jan of 2020, we added supplying PPE to my clientele and have distributed a couple million masks and face shields so far. We have also started manufacturing a lot more spray and dispensing bottles/tops for hand sanitizer and various other sanitizing products.\n\nThe only raw material change I had in 2020 was when Walmart called my office and asked for certain products to be sourced from 100% recycled materials. We adjusted quickly, changed suppliers, and production is still going strong each month. This change was not a factor of Covid. \n\nThanks for the questions! I would be very interested to hear other manufacturer's stories as well.",

It is open access, so no paywall!\nPDF link:  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/radm.12426](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/radm.12426) \n\nAbstract: \n\n We present a qualitative study of Agile Stage\u2010Gate Management (ASGM),: a hybrid new product development methodology that combines Agile and Stage\u2010Gate Management (SGM) approaches for the coordination of new product development. When applied to software projects, Agile is expected to deliver reduced development times, improved resource utilization, and greater financial success. We examine whether ASGM practitioners realize similar outcomes in a sample of global firms developing complex electro\u2010mechanical products (e.g., automobile components, railway propulsion systems, and medical devices). Our grounded theory approach articulates an understanding of ASGM through extensive interviews of experienced professionals. Our thematic analysis supports many expected benefits (i.e., speed to market, innovation enabling), but also does not encourage others, and reveals new pitfalls that deserve recognition (i.e., resource inefficiency). ASGM is not a panacea for all product development. Overall, physical product firms adopting this method can expect reduced development times and higher levels of innovation but will expend more resources to complete development projects, but a dichotomy exists. Physical product developers using ASGM experience a negative impact on project resource efficiency due to the need for dedicated resources, frequent product demonstrations, and duplicative management structures.",

I feel that I'm spinning my tires and getting no where within the company and I was trying to leave/try something new. I have been trying to get something in Finance or IT as an Analyst as I figured between my MBA and Engineering Degree, skills in Excel and knack for problem solving/analytics would make me a great fit in that type of role. However for the past year, despite getting interviews for new positions (both internal & external roles) outside of what I do, I just can't seen to get past the final interviews in most cases. From the few conversations I've had, the only thing that seems to be keeping me back is lack of experience in those particular roles. \n\nI figured that it might be better for me to just build up upon the experience I have now in manufacturing and QA/QC as I do enjoy the concepts/ideas within these areas (Automation, optimization, business process improvement, auditing etc.).\n\nWhat are some good certifications I can get for my career if I work in a warehouse/chemical/manufacturing/engineering environment? I should add that I already looked at a PMP but I don't have the experience yet for that cert. Are there any others that don't take a lot of time to get/ I don't need to have a bunch of experience yet? \n\nThanks.",

Take internships at shipping and distroubtion hubs. Take your school's trips (lots of amazon lately) and see the facilities.\n\nIf any of your local Goodwill or other places are looking for volunteers, try helping in their back room and learning how they sort/store/organize shipments. Lots of places don't have good organization, like food kitchens, food banks or donation centers run from churches or local city shelters and don't have someone they can pay but it makes for AMAZING experience for you if you can donate some of your time to help them organize and pitch in at the same time.\n\nAnything you can do to get your name out there, your foot in the door somewhere is important because above anything, planning is key. If you're interested in logistics, like i was, it may be a while till you find a decent job in it. I spent 8+ years as an IT repair technician but I worked in our warehouse, I did inventory check-in, I did part ordering, and now i'm in billing fulfilment and p/o request auth.\n\nI can't ever stress it enough, and I regret not being more involved in my college activites when I was an on campus student. I was more involved with the Air Force ROTC than I was with my degree, and after my Military career ended before it could begin, i found myself with alot of regrets going into my future.\n\nDon't decide what you want to do today.\n\nDecide what you want to do to have fun, and learn the lessons you'll take with you tomorrow.",

Anyhow, one of the majors that caught my eye was something called \"Transportation and Logistics\", it's a two year Associate of Science degree. I actually met with an advisor last week due to being interested in another program but once I got more information about it and asked about their Transportation and Logistics course it sounded much better and more interesting to me. If I were to graduate from my College with this degree I'll transfer to my local University where they offer a Bachelor in Business Administration in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and they also offer a Master of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. As of now I've decided that I'm going to give it a shot, but I'm worried that I'll end up regretting it. Ultimately it's me who will have to decide, but is it truly worth it? I've seen some people who have majored/worked in this field saying it's useless and way over hyped, but then I see others saying it's a very good and promising field. Then again I've heard both these sides from basically all majors. So I guess it boils down to personal experience. How is my outlook in this field? How do I gain experience while studying for it at the same time? Internships? How's the pay? Opportunities? Is it an intriguing career? How's the flexibility? Is it stressful or hard? Is it rewarding? What's your first job in this field like? Where do you work at? I also probably plan to double major/minor in something when I transfer to University so what's a good combination to go along with it? Any other advice or input would be appreciated, thanks.  ",

I had one of my drivers show me how they do it, and it's as simple as popping some rivets out of the door handle. \n\nDoes anyone have any practical advice on how to curb this behavior - I mean, fining and firing the carrier is fine - but I want to just have it not happen. We're not paying bottom of the barrel rates to move these lanes. Times are tough for drivers, I know, but this is straight up criminal activity.\n\nAnyone got any special tricks they do to make it prohibitive for the carrier to do this nonsense? We already use bolt seals, but what else can be done at the point of shipment departure?",

I have also come across shippers that require the forklift driver to snap pics before the driver pulls away from the dock. The more documentation the more you CYA. We mostly do it on our side so that we can document on our end in case a customer claims there was more freight on the trailer than what showed up at the consignee. Aside from that I don't know.

It's a logistics company where the products or papers are being moved to both end-users and from warehouses to supermarkets.\n\nThe second day I'm in, the biggest company my firm was working with threatened to leave them and stopped most of his operations with I believe.\n\nMy first big assignment was to standardize an excel spreadsheet so vehicles and drivers using them can be tracked daily for over a month. The thing is the format they want to work with is nowhere close to being tidy. So it's almost impossible to work with afterward. For example, A job instance where a car and a driver finish their route is spread out to two rows! This messes with other tidy data principles as you can imagine. The spreadsheet is messy!\n\nTHE BIG THING is: My company is in a crisis now where we prioritize our biggest two customers. But in order to do so, **the vehicle route optimization system had to be stopped.**\n\nNow I'm positioned with **MANUALLY** setting the routes for our 100 carriers **on the country level.** This happened yesterday and I'm working with an excel sheet. While wondering what the fuck I was doing, I've sorted up the cities, districts, and neighbors alphabetically, and criminally and randomly assigned the routes for each one of them -- Except the one major city in which I live. It ended up leaving me laughing hysterically like Joker and a shift at 1 am.\n\nI don't know what the heck they're doing now! LOL!\n\nWhere do I go from here? It's obvious this isn't a DS job I ended up. At least not for a couple of months. My two questions can be categorized as near-field and general worries:\n\nWhat do heck do I do now? I will probably have to keep track of a lot of things and repeat this process of manually setting the routes for the carries a lot. Do you think it makes sense to try and automate this? This will be probably over in two months or less. I'll probably get fired or company shrinks - and I get fired again!\n\nAre there any helpful tracking web apps or services that could help me with this period? Like spreadsheets, open source Softwares? Anything.\n\nOr do you think I should go balls deep and start using Google APIs to try and implement vehicle route optimization? The thing is I'm way too alone for this and this doesn't look like a single person's job, especially with a BUSY time schedule.",

Explain that in order to do the optimization you\u2019re being asked to do that it requires XYZ resources or will take XYZ amount of time with available resources. Show initiative and expertise. Remind them that you\u2019re there to solve the problem and you\u2019re committed to doing so (willing to work hard) but have these various challenges. \n\n2) Start looking for another job and then quit once you have something.

We all should know who they are. They call nonstop and have a reputation of being a meat grinder and very few brokers come out of there with follow up careers in the freight industry. I was a successful broker  who wanted to step down from sales. It was not for me. While I had a great book of business making over $100k in my first year of sales I was burnt and broken. I moved to an operational role and found myself changing processes to protect the company while making sales more successful. What I got was a deeper understanding of how the freight industry operated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left that organization and walked into a Transportation Manager role. There I learned international freight management. What was required to clear shipments out of the US and into many other countries. I learned that it is a dirty business full of all sorts of pitfalls and how to overcome a variety of issues from simple to complex. I worked there for years become a known person where I'm from. I've mentored others in this industry from other organizations and carry a good reputation where I'm from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood enough to be poached for a high salary in more of a consultant role for an organization who fired me for being disabled. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it seems that everywhere around me organizations see what I bring to the table and unfortunately are throwing numbers at me that were even below where I previously worked. These are organizations that have been trying to hire me for years for my industry knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do I go from here?",

How could  i calculate the savings or how long does it take to get the cost back? \n\nBy the way, I think the whole task seems to be that i got too little information to fully answer the questions. Or Am I just too dumb for this? :)\n\nThank you for your answers for advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the full task:  \n\nRlibrary conversion task\n\nYou have been entrusted with the review of the raw material warehouse of a producing company.\n\nWarehouse description\n\n  \n The warehouse is a narrow ailing high warehouse, 61 m wide and 45 m long. The narrow corridor is 1.7 m wide and the stand is 7.4 m high. The length of the beams of the stand is 1.8 m, the width of the columns is 0.2 m. There is a distance of 0.25 m between two side-by-side racks due to anti-overs. The thickness of the shelves is 0.15 m, between them the distance is uniformly 1.1 m on all 6 levels. 2 EU pallets are stored on one rack per level. 14 times in two rows, the raw materials are stored on 18 racks. The racks start from the wall of the warehouse, as shown in the diagram, opposite this, peri-directionally to the rows, the goods arrive on one side of a wide corridor and are released from the warehouse on the other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3krjfm0swvu51.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff28899fe6e06834114f52ece77f4b4dcd2e8eaa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n\nProcess description\n\nThere are three sizes of raw materials in the warehouse: large, medium and small, the quantity of which on pallets is 35%, 40% and 15% of the stock.\n\nThe mass of large materials exceeds 25 kg. Cranes can be used for repacking them, but manual transfer is also permitted. Cranes can be reached only at the exit of the warehouse. After manual transfer, the worker must take a short rest. 6-8 of these parts are stored on an EU pallet. The height of the stacks is 1 m.\n\nMedium-sized materials are stored in iron crates in bulk. Their weight varies between 1 and 5 kg each. They are moved manually one by one. The iron crates are eu pallet-based and have a height of 0.8 m.\n\nSmall parts (screws, washers, etc.) come in cardboard boxes. The boxes are 0.4 m wide and 0.6 m long and have a height of 0.15 m. The boxes are stored on an EU pallet stacked up to 5 levels.\n\nIncoming materials are randomly stored in empty storage. High storage spaces (from level 3 up) can only be handled with a high-lift narrow-ailing forklift. The lower storage spaces can also be accessed by a walk-by forklift. In all cases, entry into storage is carried out by high-lift narrow-ailing forklifts. \n\nThe materials needed for production are collected one shift in advance and stored in the wall-side of the corridor. When harvesting, the worker receives a list of materials required for production, which starts to collect the exact quantity on a pallet moved by a walking forklift. If the material to be collected is in a high storage area, it must be worked with a high-lift forklift, which first lifts the necessary pallet for it, puts it between the rows and waits for the necessary quantity to be removed from it, and then puts the residue back where it was taken off. During collection, you need at least half a pallet of large parts, up to two pallets, 30-50 of medium-sized parts, 200-500 pieces of small parts, which are always accurately calculated.\n\nThere are currently 3 high-lift forklifts and 8 walking forklifts in the warehouse. The machines are rented, not owned by them.\n\n  \n\nCompany comments\n\nThe change in production can be slowly reacted by the warehouse, i.e. it is necessary to wait a long time for a defective component to be changed.\n\nCongestion often develops in the hallway.\n\nThe high-lift narrow-ailing forklifts are burdened.\n\nThose working in the walking forklift will have to wait a long time. \n\nA 20% increase in traffic is expected in the future.\n\nThe size of the warehouse cannot be changed, but its installation and operation can. The company has the components needed to convert the racks (height and number of levels), but you will have to take into account the restructuring fee.\n\nIssues\n\nDo you consider the warehouse to be adequate/sufficient? If not, what difference would you make? \n\nDo you consider the warehouse equipment to be appropriate? If not, what difference would you make?\n\nHow much savings can the company make by changing the way the warehouse works? When would the costs of converting the warehouse pay off?\n\nCould the company be able to match the projected increase in turnover?",

        "content": "Transportation Companies During Lockdown\n \n\n**Daily movement of trucks** **has collapsed to less than 10% of normal levels, according to All India Motor Transport Congress, an umbrella body of goods vehicle operators representing about 10 million truckers.**\u00a0\n\n**Road transport accounts for about 60% of freight traffic in India and 87% of its passenger traffic, according to Road ministry.**\n\n**Starting April 20, the central government relaxed certain lockdown guidelines to restart select commercial activities such as the transport of goods.**\u00a0\n\n**All goods, not just essential products as permitted in the first phase of what is now an over 40-day nation-wide lockdown. Yet only 15 to 20 percent of the over 90 lakh trucks in India are back on the road.**\n\n**The reasons range from hurdles in accessing e-passes needed to travel across districts and states, to absent truck drivers, to lack of labour to load goods at factories and warehouses.**\u00a0\n\n[**Transportation Companies**](http://www.navata.com/cms/transportation-companies-during-lockdown/) **during lockdown\u00a0 aren\u2019t able to open warehouses, consolidation is not taking place, parcel movement is not taking place, express movement is not taking place, Pradeep Singal, national president of All India Transporters Welfare**\n\n**It will take some more time I think, one to one and a half months before normalcy returns, even after the full lockdown is removed (May 4). For the markets to start, for factories to start, and the loads to be available from both sides.**\n\n**According to a report, over 20 per cent of the trucks are stuck on the roads across the country. Drivers and support personnel could be anywhere around 30 lakh. Most of them face a loss of income. One can categorise trucks as those with large operators (either** [4PL or 3PLs](http://www.navata.com/cms/transportation-companies-during-lockdown/)**) as part of a contract engagement and those running as market vehicles.**\n\n**In India, the rail transport is supply-driven. The government and related agencies use rail for the movement of crude and petroleum, coal, minerals, and so on. Since the user companies are not operating in full capacity, it will return to normalcy. It is likely that the railways is using the lockdown for optimal redistribution of foodgrains. Analytics can be deployed for better capacity utilisation of cargo movement when the lockdown is in force, and passenger movement is restricted.**\n\n**The emotional health of many truck drivers have been affected . A lot of ground-level support through counselling will be required. NGOs and professionals can be engaged in providing comfort to this group of employees and getting them back on board.**",

What POS do you use for your medium sized business?\nNaturally, like me, you\u2019re probably using Shopify POS, Clover, Square, or any of those \u201cTop 10 best POS systems for your business\u201d systems. But these unfortunately are very limiting, and restricting, and aren\u2019t beneficial to a retail store that moves a lot of merchandise. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is something that could sync with a solid WMS (Warehouse Management System) / IMS (Inventory MS), [which I would love to know the name of as well], which would allow me to track multi-store inventory, as well as track track bin locations (stock shelf location code) for my multi-store locations, all for 1 SKU. I would need a system that can track multiple SKUs for 1 SKU. For example, my own made up SKU + product SKU in 2 separate text boxes for 1 item. The system would need a solid barcode labeling system as well, with many label shapes and sizes available and full label print option customization. And lastly, a great integration system, to sync with my Shopify website, quick books, ship station, and of course the WMS/IMS. But for all this to help me, I need a solid POS system (maybe even an All in One? WMS + POS) for front end retail sales. I need to be able to pull all of this information up quickly, barcode scan, customize multiple receipt options, such as gift receipts, etc. and have a gift card system as well. \n\nI don\u2019t know why, with months of looking at everything I can online, the only conclusion I can gather is that this type of system doesn\u2019t exist. If you can possibly direct me to something that falls somewhere in line with what I\u2019m looking for, or maybe assist me in letting me know what other medium sized businesses use, and how they created/got such a system, I\u2019m pretty desperate and would greatly appreciate your help.

During my time i have held all the positions from merchandiser to assistant manager and every thing in between. Being in this position takes a lot of patience, and being able to ignore when customers do our say dumb things.\n\nWell, on new years day, my store was closed, but me and a co-worker went in to catch up on the last 2 weeks worth of work that we feel behind on because of the holiday season, and being really overly short staffed. We have had holiday hours signs posted for about a month now, right beside where our regular hours signs are. So all day long we saw customers try and push their way through the doors and walk away defeated (which is hilarious to see). Around 9:45, which is 15 minutes before we would normally close, a guy starts banging on the window, i look at him and he traps his wrist to try and say it isn't closing time yet, open the door.\n\nI signal to him to come to the door so that i can show him the holiday hours sign, and tell him which stores are open. When he got to the door he wouldn't look at me and was ready to push the door open the second i unlocked it. So, because I'm not about to let some Rando in the store, and i don't like when people do the watch tap thing to me, i knocked on the glass the same way he did and pointed to the sign, and started walking away. He starts telling at me telling me the large red sign that says \"holiday hours\" is not in a good spot. As i was walking away i said back \"maybe you should look with your eyes open next time\". He heard and said something but i was already walking away.\n\n90% sure I'm going to get a complaint about it, but I couldn't care less. Read the sign and don't be an ass.",

If you don't know what Rear Dunn is it's basically china that looks like your daughter made it at pottery class, but Joanna Gains deemed it worthy so every southern Karen is officially in the game and on the hunt as it's only sold through one main company. Our store maintains a very high level of discipline when it comes to our employees handling Rae Dunn. Everyone is very trained on the party lines \"I can't confirm any stock, you'll just have to come in store and see\" \"we only get what we get and it goes out when it's ready\" \"items aren't septated by brand in shipment so we don't know what boxes will have it and how quickly we can get to them\". Everyone knows who the main hunters are, or as we call them \"The Karens\" \"The RDB (Rae Dunn Bitches) Gang\" or when speaking to another employee \"Your Special Friends\". We avoid them like they're Jehovah's Witness and when we see them coming we will literally hide anywhere. \n\nOur morning always starts by trying to get past them waiting outside the doors before we open. They arrive as early as 3 hours before we open. When we do finally turn the lock, with their hands already in the door pushing before it's open and eyes locked in on the cart they will grab, these women burst in, snag a cart, and full on sprint to the home goods section. They will scoop up every piece they know they call sell and then desperately check around the store for more. We like to take the first 5-10 minutes of our day to watch them feed like vultures and screech over holiday pieces as they shove each other around and bicker. Then we hurry as fast as we can to get as far away because we know what comes next. They will find us, I've had one RDB follow be into the bathroom and harass me through the stall door. They will start simply enough \"hey friend! So was there a truck today?\" And will quickly escalate to their more usual \"what the hell are you doing back there I can see a tank of dishes through the stockroom for window get it on the floor or I'll go back there myself!!\" And heaven forbid when they \"know for sure\" an item is \"predicted to launch\" in our store today like they get a shipment manifest. They will hound you every 5 minutes with pictures from other RDB's in their Facebook groups saying \"look!! Such and such sure had it so you need to go find it right now!!\" They block our doorway, they attack our tanks (carts) when we come out the door, the tear into all boxes and packages with their own razor blades from home and search for their precious ceramics. The frequently break other merchandise in their craziness and always leave a huge mess. When they do find what they want they God help you if someone doesn't get one because it gets ugly. Everyone takes sides, there lots of screaming and often crying, and it's been very common in our store for physical altercations to happen which result in us calling the police. I've seen woman just pull back and full on deck someone in the face, I've also seen several people intentionally pick up a piece they know someone wants and smash it on the floor as \"payback\" for that person taking something she wanted last time. And as if opening wasn't a bad enough circus, sometimes they will stay in the store for 5+ hours or come back 3-4 times throughout the day. What is even worse is when they bring their young children and not only set this example but force them to participate by blocking aisles so someone can't go look for something, or hunting other parts of the store for hidden pieces, or just standing guard to alert their mom when another RDB comes in. \n\nThis is the most horrifying and disgusting thing I've had to see in all my years of retail. Anyone who collects Rae Dunn is on my list of people who need a mental evaluation and I simply won't hear the \"I'm a casual/normal/calm/occasional collector!\" excuse. This thing has become a nasty culture that people shouldn't want to be associated with.",

The brand has their own representatives who work in our area and handle their items. The woman found a dress that had a hole in it. The hole was in a seam. She brought it up and asked if she could get a discount for damaged merchandise. The representative called the brand's manager, who was off that day, and asked her. The  manager told her that it's the brand's policy that they couldn't sell damaged merchandise, so she couldn't sell her the dress.\n\nThe woman starts flipping out. \"What do you mean you can't sell it? You're just going to damage it out anyway! I want it!\" Blah blah blah. I heard all this, but didn't pay much attention because I was helping someone who wasn't a complete shithead. When I finish my customers' transactions, I take their returns to the back room and stay back there a bit with some other associates because birthday food was involved and I pigged out on cream puffs.\n\nWhen I came back, all the girls in my area were laughing and talking about the woman from earlier. Apparently after I left, she raised all hell. Apparently one of the girls asked if there was a chance she may have accidentally put tore the dress while she was looking at it. She took it as an accusation. She went on and on about how she was a lawyer and blah blah blah.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, the brand's manager comes in. I was helping another customer with a complicated transaction. The woman comes back and starts raising hell again. I tried to ignore her because my customer was a bit flustered for a few reasons, one of which was her baby which was being fussy and crying. I think the kid was sick, and that woman screaming at the brand manager and my coworkers only made the poor thing more upset.\n\nFor some reason, this woman decides to get me involved. She grabs my arm and starts yelling at me stuff like, \"DON'T YOU ***DARE*** LET ***THEM*** PUT THAT DRESS BACK ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET ***ME***  BUY IT.\" I just nodded my head and tries to go back to my customer.\n\nThe brand manger tried to make things better and explain the policy to her, but that only made it worse. The woman starts yelling something about how the brand manager came out of nowhere and must have been hiding or something like that, and demanded I tell her that she just showed up out of nowhere. I wanted to tell her that, yes, she came in because she was called by a stressed employee, but I just said, \"I don't know, I didn't see.\"\n\nOh Lord, that made her angry. She started yelling at me that \"SHE JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE! HOW COULD YOU HAVE NOT SEEN? YOU WERE RIGHT THERE!!!\" Lady, I was minding my own business helping other customers. She also insulted the brand manager, who's super cool and sweet, all for having tattoos and piercings (she looks like a rock star and I fucking love her style.) There was also screaming about something along the lines of \"YOU THINK I CAN'T AFFORD THIS DRESS? I HAVE MONEY, I'M A LAWYER! I HAVE MONEY.\"\n\nThis is my first cashiering job, so this is my first encounter with a customer like this. Normally, I have an attitude, and where I used to work, I got away with having a pretty bad attitude towards customers who treated me or my coworkers like shit. Somehow, I managed to keep my cool and ignore her, not because I need my job, but because that baby in front of me was in distress and if I had told that woman off, it may have made that baby's day a lot worse.\n\nIn the end, the entitled bitch demanded everyone's name, position, rank, wanted to speak to every manager in the store including our store manager who is on vacation.\n\nAlso, I think she put the hole in the dress, doesn't actually have the money for it and isn't actually a lawyer. But whatever.\n\nCan't wait for more of this shit!",

They got irritated when told that the computers split the price. To keep people from doing that. Found kids bathing suits covered in pee in the dressing rooms. The protocol before was to trash them because it was a biohazard, then defect them using price tags. Too many people starting doing that and would wait until later to hop in dumpsters to get out. New policy was to leave them in a bag in the defective area. Some good times too, but those don\u2019t make very interesting stories.",

I haven\u2019t done any online training or filled in any paperwork so I assume that will be part of it but other than that I have no idea what to expect. I\u2019ve never worked retail before so I\u2019m pretty terrified. If you could let me know your experience your first shift in fashion retail or a related field I would be so grateful!!!

Digital signage allows marketers to develop attractive content to catch attention, push sales, reimagine the in-store experience and drive people traffic into stores.\n\n**Benefits of Digital Signage**\n\nVarious surveys conclude that effective digital signage can have a considerable impact on consumers:\n\n* 68% of customers note that digital signage would make them more likely to buy advertised products (Mood Media)\n* 44% of customers state that digital signage can influence them to buy an advertised product instead of the product they had planned to purchase (Mood Media)\n* Tracking 120 grocers who utilise digital signage found that 80% of these companies saw sales uplift of up to 33% (Nielsen)\n\nTherefore, it comes as no surprise that digital signage installations are growing by c. 40% year-on-year with retail accounting for 25% of the market (Mood Media).\n\nDigital signage helps **bring in customers** by creating a powerful, engaging window display. \u00a0These displays have the potential to offer **personalised experiences** for consumers, offering tailored promotions and deals, through a programmatic platform, treating the display like a media platform. The latest digital signage software also offers retailers **complete adaptability**; there are no costs or delays in setting prices, listing features or changing content. Digital signage also helps to take the drudge out of the shopping experience, **aiding the customer buying decisio**n as various retailers are now using displays to offer robust product comparisons for customers.\n\n**Digital Signage Apparatus**\n\nThere are a whole host of applications relating to digital signage that are suitable for retailers:\n\n* **Indoor LED:** Offer high quality imagery and colour reproduction; particularly useful in cosmetics and clothing displays. These are also incredibly versatile and can be placed within virtually any part of the store from the floor to the ceiling\n* **Window Displays:** Proven way to draw more visitors inside the store, particularly through the use of animations\n* **Advertising Displays:** Proven to increase sales by up to 33%, footfall by 24% and impulse purchases by 20%\n* **Product Information Points:** provide on-the-fly product information on offers\n* **Staff Communication Displays:** helps to engage, motivate and set targets by giving staff boosts throughout the day\n\n**Digital Signage in Practice**\n\nAs the use of [digital signage](http://www.weareamnet.com/digital-production/) continues to increase, here are a small number of examples, where digital signage has been successful\u2026\u2026\n\n* **Nordstrom**, a leading American fashion retailer, has developed a \u201cDigital Denim Doctor\u201d which recommends the best jeans for the user after assessing the user\u2019s body type, lifestyle and fabric preferences\n* **Sephora**, a French-based cosmetics beauty retailer, has created a ModiFace digital display which allows customers to virtually try on Sephora products. These displays have reduced the number of product returns and exchanges, whilst also drawing greater attention to Sephora\u2019s pop-in stores which now have larger retail space\n* **Rebecca Minkoff**, a global American fashion brand, has introduced \u201csmart\u201d mirrors which bring an entire catalogue into the dressing room. These dressing rooms allow customers to order additional clothes or sizes from the fitting rooms, and also allow users to adjust the lighting to help them in the buying decision\n\nTo find out how Amnet can support, scale and deliver your advertising and digital projects, please contact us at [hello@weareamnet.com](mailto:hello@weareamnet.com)",

I am a programmer who works for a supermarket chain and I am involved in the software used for inventory control (it is our software), and we are looking to improve the way our system is used to reorder products to the central warehouse and also to our suppliers who deliver directly to the stores.\n\nRight now the order for any product is calculated from the current inventory, the time it takes for orders to arrive, a forecast, and a safety factor.\n\nI think that using this method for all products is VERY inefficient.  For example, I figure that products which are reordered from our central warehouse might be better replenished by using a system such that when the stock reaches a given \"minimum\" stock level an order is placed to a given pre-defined \"maximum\" stock level.\n\nIt ocurred to me that these replenishment processes should be more or less standard in the supermarket industry.

Stay at home!\nHi everyone.\n\nI work in the hardware section of retail here in the UK and like supermarkets and pharmacies, we are seen as essential.\n\nThe reason for this is in case people have plumbing or electrical issues and to help the self employed do their parts in fixing those problems.... at least that is what i thought when i returned to work after a week off.\n\nMy company are working on a click and collect/delivery basis which puts me at a lot less of a risk than those as supermarkets as customers are not allowed to enter the store. However what concerns me is the amount of non-essential items that are being ordered every day. \n\nI think this message needs to be made clear to people.... your DIY projects are not essential. Painting your bedroom because you are bored is not a good enough reason to go out and put not only the staff at risk, but yourself and as an extension your family too. Any one of the staff picking your orders and getting them for you could have the virus and be passing it on to numerous people per day. That of course makes the vorus spread and puts further strain on health services and results in more deaths.\n\nWe have seen a drop off in customer count since we made the change, but it is not as significant as it should be because people are heading out to do their DIY projects because they are bored. None of us are at work to facilitate your boredom, we are at work because we are seen as an essential business and we have to be there to keep homes with electric, water and heating. Many of us would rather be at home with our families and be safe, and i admit i am one of them, but we have to come to work in order to pay the bills etc... \n\nI am anxious every day going to work because i feel like i am putting not only my health at risk, but the health of others for what i feel like is no good reason. I understand it is a bad situation we are all in, but we will not get through this if everyone does not play their part. For many people, i get that being stuck inside all day really sucks, but just remember why you are being told to stay indoors and only leave the house for essential reasons.\n\nStay safe everyone",

I don't think he gets the issue.   \nI was chilling down town by the court house earlier today and saw a fair amount of people out on the streets, shooting the breeze and this homeless looking man walking down the sidewalk. After he passed the vehicle I was sitting in he coughed near a group of folks talking to each other, and then about 5 minutes later I heard one of them sneeze. I don't think the vast majority of people is taking this seriously, and it is making me angry.\n\nI am thinking of calling my mayor tomorrow and seeing if I can get him to enforce this 'essential travel only' rule. I don't think I have heard of a single person being questioned by the police for why they are out.",

        "content": "Dear Customers,\nWith all due respect, you're killing people. \n\nOur store remains open to provide you the essentials of life, food products, hygiene products, and medicine. Our workers labor long hours, clean each individual cart multiple times a day, stand by a register and scan your 6 packs of toilet paper that you snagged the moment they hit the shelf. \n\nWe dutifully and patiently check out the non-essentials you have loaded your cart down with. We don't understand why you came out, despite the regulations put in place to protect us all from COVID-19, just to purchase home decor, plushies, and knick-knacks. We don't understand why we see you come in nearly every day, scouring the clearance section for new deals, but we stay quiet. We ask you how you are, and tell you to have a great day as you and the four friends that came with you leave to load your vehicle down with the non-essentials you came to shop for. \nWe see that you are not following the rules, and that you seem to care little that people are dying. \n\nWe see you come in, hacking up a lung, without covering your mouth, and we say nothing. We just hope and pray that we can get through another day without becoming sick. We check out hundreds of customers a day. Our hands are cracking from covering them in rubbing alcohol every time we handle your cash. \n\nWe risk our lives to serve you. This is a terrifying time. And yet, my experience since this all began has been indescribable. \n\nIn the past several days I have gone to work, covering my mouth with a bandana, holding onto some tiny shred of hope that I won't be exposed, that this flimsy piece of cloth will protect me. And in these past several days, despite the lockdown, despite the many rules put in place to protect people, and to flatten the curve, I have seen five times the amount of customers come into my store than ever before. Our parking lot is nearly full, all day. I cannot stock, I cannot complete my other duties around the store, as I stand at the register with a line of at least five people all day. I hear the beep of the automatic doors as they slide open every few minutes. The people in line do not stand in the spots marked by tape to distance themselves from others. They stand right on top of each other. They enter the store in groups upwards of six people, with little regard to social distancing. They are not shopping just for essentials, they are shopping for clothes, decor, and clearance items. They are chatting in the aisles. They are coming in with their children, allowing their children to crawl in our floors. The elderly are scared, but subjected to a store packed full of people when they must come in for the food they need for the week. We know that you are stealing toilet paper from our restrooms, as the empty cardboard roles are not present in the bathroom at the end of the night, not in the trash, nor in the floor. And we know that you are aware of the coronavirus. We know you have heard the projections for just how many people it can kill. Trust us, you are not immune, young or old, you can catch this, and you can die from it. We clean all of our surfaces, and we clean thoroughly. But this is an airborne disease. We cannot clean the air. \nWe know that you come in sick, maybe playing it off as allergies, or even saying it's a smokers' cough, and we are scared. Very few of you cover your mouths when you cough. We have seen so many of you coughing openly, not even attempting to cover your mouth. We are scared, but we continue to give you service with a smile. You are the very people who are spreading this. You are the people who will cause significantly more deaths than should result from this. \n\nAs an end note, we are not bothered by the people who come alone, representing their whole family, and buying only the essentials. We praise those people, they are the people who are actually doing their part. \nWe are however deeply concerned, and quite frankly, terrified by the people who continue to bum rush our store every day, in swarms, with no regard to the health or safety of others. We are scared, and you may not realize it now, but you're spreading the disease, and your irresponsible actions now will result in the deaths of others later. You're killing people. If you can happily come to terms with that, then by all means, continue down the road you are currently on. \n\nSincerely, \n\nA terrified retail worker.",

        "content": "Toy Retailer Won't Close in Face of Global Pandemic\nHad original post deleted by mods so I am posting it here. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nBeing in retail is tough right now, I understand that the market is volatile and the future, at this point, is generating more questions and uncertainty than it is answers. I have worked for Mastermind Toys for the past several years as a front-line, customer facing employee and their current path of decisions and business practices are worse than EB Games.  Let me explain:\n\nLet me take you back a few weeks. COVID-19 is gaining traction as a global pandemic, March Break is around the corner and (in Ontario at least) schools are mandating that students be off an extra 2 weeks after the March Break. We witnessed parents were panic-buying toys, activities and workbooks for the 3 week quarantine with their children and up to 5 weeks if they also celebrated Passover.  As a result, Mastermind Toys noticed a larger than usual uptick in shopping.\n\nMastermind Toys is desperate for business and waited until the 11th hour to cancel their free, in-store March Break activities (a yearly sales-driver to bring people into their stores to shop).  This decision came days after competing companies, such as Indigo, had already cancelled theirs.\n\nAll stores remained open.\n\nAs the pandemic grew and tensions rose, the staff in my store became increasingly concerned and worried. Mastermind Toys HR department released a copy/paste memo giving no insight or details regarding increased safety precautions the company was taking to protect the employees or customers -- it simply requested that you wash your hands or use hand sanitizer more frequently and to call in sick if you weren't feeling well.\n\nOn March 16th, the Ontario government mandated that all restaurants, bars and clubs were to close or adapt a take-out only model for food.  They also 'strongly suggested' that all non-essential businesses do the same.  Self-Isolate. Social Distancing.  These are the new buzz words that have become so common, so quickly.  Mastermind Toys kept their stores open -- business as usual.\n\nShortly after, all Indigo locations recognized the severity of the global pandemic and voluntarily closed up all bricks and mortar stores -- promising to pay it's employees for their scheduled shifts.  The day afterwards, Toys R Us followed suit.\n\nAll Mastermind Toys stores remained open.\n\nHere is where it gets interesting.  It wasn't until Thursday, March 19th that Mastermind announced, via email to their customers, that they would be closing their doors to the public -- they did NOT contact their employees regarding this decision beforehand.  All part-time employees would be temporarily fired so that they could collect EI from the government. Any negative comments on their social media were quickly deleted.\n\nAll stores were labelled as \"closed\" -- but this isn't the case at all.\n\nAll full-time staff, such as the Store Manager and Assistant Manager of each location, are still employed and were not allowed to self-isolate with everyone else.  If they did, it would come out of their vacation/sick days.  Instead, they were asked to come into their store and monitor the Click & Collect program.  Anyone who uses the Mastermind website could reserve items for in-store purchase and pick-up.  Think \"retail takeout\" -- continuing to put staff and customers at risk of exposure.\n\nAs of this posting, all stores remain open.\n\nTL;DR - Mastermind Toys has continued to stay open during a global pandemic while many other big-box retailers have recognized the severity of the situation and shuttered their doors, preventing further spread.  Toys are NOT an essential service.",

I\u2019m a lead at a popular sporting good\u2019s store and my boss seems to either want me to quit or fire me/demote me for being pregnant?\n\nWhen I told him I was pregnant he told me it was \u201cincredibly inconvenient for him\u201d. Umm okay. \n\nSince then he has told me that if I\u2019m going to use the bathroom every 30 minutes that he needs me to do something else in the store which would result in less pay since I would no longer be a lead. Sometimes overrides etc are needed and I\u2019m in the bathroom, taking a pee.\n\nHe had me work overnights doing pretty significant physical labor that I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing just a few weeks ago. He wanted me to work from 8pm-10am and then come back in the same day at 4pm until 11 to close. I told him I wouldn\u2019t get any sleep and he said \u201cI\u2019m not concerned with your sleep schedule\u201d.\n\nAnd most recently he told me he understands after baby is here I won\u2019t want to work as much so he\u2019s happy to demote me to a cashier\u2019s position. I have had no conversation or have said anything saying I wanted that and plan to come back and work just as I always have after my maternity leave. He also argued with me that my maternity leave is only 2 weeks when it is in fact 8.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do and this seems slightly against the rules somehow?",

        "content": "Just reminiscing\nI had a nervous breakdown a while back. (Aug.Dec.) the time frame is fuzzy. Went to work the next day because my job wouldn't let me talk a personal day. She got mad because I wouldn't tell her why. Obviously, I wasn't in any capacity to work. I KNEW that something was gonna happen resulting in me losing my job. This day there was a storm brewing and people were panic buying groceries. We were already shorthanded and overworked. A regular comes in, a senior Grandma with her devil spawn offspring. The child gets a electric cart that I assumed for the GM and rides around the store while the GM walks around pushing a regular cart which I thought was wrong. Managers never do shit and always put in on me to deal with. So I had to go tell the child to give it to her grandmother or get off it. We only ever had 2 working ones and you always had to keep them charged anyway. Child wont get off it. Crocodile tears are coming. I really dont want to argue. I say look, get off it or I'll get a manager. And we go back and forth. Mind you i have witnesses who told management i did nothing wrong. The brat gets off and goes outside. I go back to my register. The brat comes back it with her mother whose 300 lbs 6\"2 mind you im a very tall 5\"4. I'm not scared of nobody but Jesus so if she wanted to roll we could've lol. Anyway the mother comes in hollering. \"Ah shit, here we go\" I say to myself. The child lied to her mom that I yelled and yanked her off the cart. So like, listen I have shit going on, I didn't need this so damn right I hold my own tired of people pushing me around. We didnt need to go back and forth but we did. I was wrong she was wrong and that child was wrong. There were so many ways I could've handled that better. But that mother didn't parent her child right. And the poor grandmother got put on the backburner. Shes upset trying to tell her daughter that I didnt do anything wrong this that and the other.... I quit on the spot. At the end of the day, shes always gonna be who she is. I was upset with myself because I'm better than that. Doesn't matter to me anymore, I'm free from that toxic environment. My mom tells me they still ask about me and want me to come back. There's other issues there. They are SHIT people anyway, racist AF. And you shoulda treated me better.",

Please give me tips to help me get rehired.\nI walked out on a supermarket job a year ago. I called corporate and they said there's nothing that should prevent me from being rehired. I was being bullied because I'm an introvert and I worked at a very ethnic store full of Hispanics and I didn't know Spanish. Even though most of them didn't know English, I was seen as the bad guy for not being able to communicate with them. The managers that I liked when I started had long since left, and it was clear they didn't want me working there anymore. I didn't give two weeks notice because they were treating me badly (openly talking badly about me in Spanish to customers, making me feel like nothing I did was good enough, refusing to give me constructive feedback, etc.). I felt if I gave two weeks, they would have ramped up the abuse. I didn't have another job lined up, so I have a gap on my resume as a result. I figure working for a different store would be different, because I won't be working with the same managers that caused me to leave in the first place. If I'm asked about my experience with the company in the past, what can I say? What excuse could I give for leaving without notice? I assume I should be upfront about this, because if they call up the store they'll be able to find out what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr walked out on a store, want to get rehired at a different store within the same company, but I essentially walked out without giving notice. I know I should be rehirable, but they can easily call up my store and find out I left on bad terms. What tips would you have for me to get rehired because I need a job?",

If they are really out to get you for whatever reason, they COULD talk badly about you, but I honestly wouldn't worry about it.  \n\n\nJust try it. During the interview, if they ask \"why did you left in the first place\" or anything along those lines just explain it wasn't a good fit at that store and you feel you'd fit in better at THIS store. Of course, ET CETERA ET CETERA, it can be worded in any way, but; I probably would never bring up you felt you got bullied, there were language barriers, or I wasn't treated very nice.  \n\n\nIt's retail, in the end I don't think anyone cares if you left without notice months before. If your old store harbors ANY animosity, you can lay peacefully knowing the store you'd like to work at has no idea who you are, will never get a full understanding of your prior work experience at that store, and would only figure it out themselves who you are as a worker for this company at THEIR store.  \n\n\nThat's what is nice about retail, different chains have so many different stores, so many different people... so many opportunities to try again at a different store.  \n\n\nI worked at a Super Target and quit without notice, I just decided to stop showing up. I think I'd be able to get hired again if my current job doesn't pan out. I don't think I have to worry about that since I am loving my job and everyone at least seems to love me, but I wouldn't hesitate to try Target again at a different store if something happened.  \n\n\nJust try it. Tell them you weren't a good fit, don't mention walking out, don't mention the language barriers and bullying. You're not lying if you say it wasn't a good fit, because it wasn't. Just leave out the specifics. If they press, just say \"Management and I didn't 100% agree on everything.\" but I seriously doubt you'd have to worry about them pressing you on your work experience and trying to deluge every single detail out of you.",

        "content": "The one where Rae Dunn Ruins Everyone's Day At Work\nWhile working at (redacted) I've learned many things, one of them being that Rae Dunn collectors/resellers are the fourth circle of hell. If you don't know what Rear Dunn is it's basically china that looks like your daughter made it at pottery class, but Joanna Gains deemed it worthy so every southern Karen is officially in the game and on the hunt as it's only sold through one main company. Our store maintains a very high level of discipline when it comes to our employees handling Rae Dunn. Everyone is very trained on the party lines \"I can't confirm any stock, you'll just have to come in store and see\" \"we only get what we get and it goes out when it's ready\" \"items aren't septated by brand in shipment so we don't know what boxes will have it and how quickly we can get to them\". Everyone knows who the main hunters are, or as we call them \"The Karens\" \"The RDB (Rae Dunn Bitches) Gang\" or when speaking to another employee \"Your Special Friends\". We avoid them like they're Jehovah's Witness and when we see them coming we will literally hide anywhere. \n\nOur morning always starts by trying to get past them waiting outside the doors before we open. They arrive as early as 3 hours before we open. When we do finally turn the lock, with their hands already in the door pushing before it's open and eyes locked in on the cart they will grab, these women burst in, snag a cart, and full on sprint to the home goods section. They will scoop up every piece they know they call sell and then desperately check around the store for more. We like to take the first 5-10 minutes of our day to watch them feed like vultures and screech over holiday pieces as they shove each other around and bicker. Then we hurry as fast as we can to get as far away because we know what comes next. They will find us, I've had one RDB follow be into the bathroom and harass me through the stall door. They will start simply enough \"hey friend! So was there a truck today?\" And will quickly escalate to their more usual \"what the hell are you doing back there I can see a tank of dishes through the stockroom for window get it on the floor or I'll go back there myself!!\" And heaven forbid when they \"know for sure\" an item is \"predicted to launch\" in our store today like they get a shipment manifest. They will hound you every 5 minutes with pictures from other RDB's in their Facebook groups saying \"look!! Such and such sure had it so you need to go find it right now!!\" They block our doorway, they attack our tanks (carts) when we come out the door, the tear into all boxes and packages with their own razor blades from home and search for their precious ceramics. The frequently break other merchandise in their craziness and always leave a huge mess. When they do find what they want they God help you if someone doesn't get one because it gets ugly. Everyone takes sides, there lots of screaming and often crying, and it's been very common in our store for physical altercations to happen which result in us calling the police. I've seen woman just pull back and full on deck someone in the face, I've also seen several people intentionally pick up a piece they know someone wants and smash it on the floor as \"payback\" for that person taking something she wanted last time. And as if opening wasn't a bad enough circus, sometimes they will stay in the store for 5+ hours or come back 3-4 times throughout the day. What is even worse is when they bring their young children and not only set this example but force them to participate by blocking aisles so someone can't go look for something, or hunting other parts of the store for hidden pieces, or just standing guard to alert their mom when another RDB comes in. \n\nThis is the most horrifying and disgusting thing I've had to see in all my years of retail. Anyone who collects Rae Dunn is on my list of people who need a mental evaluation and I simply won't hear the \"I'm a casual/normal/calm/occasional collector!\" excuse. This thing has become a nasty culture that people shouldn't want to be associated with.",

As soon as she walked away I group of very young kids came in (the oldest behind maybe 12 and youngest looking about 9). As they came in and out it was hard to tell exactly how many there were but it was between 10-12. Only one of them was trying on clothes and the others meandered about but soon started getting rowdy. One of the boys started kicking up in the air trying to kick the girls which resulted in lots of screaming and laughing. They actually asked a customer if they could have her cart and she looked very startled and gave it to them and walked away. They climbed in it and started ramming into walls and each other. I made a quick move to get ahold of the cart and tell them to get out and not touch another one. They then sat and started talking about school last week where one girl led with \"well I shanked two kids last week\" a boy followed with \"girl that's nothing a shanked a teacher, bet Tanisha never shanked nobody\" to which a girl, presumably Tanisha, replied \"I ain't got time to shank, when I'm at school I'm trying to get the bathroom pass to go have sex with my boyfriend\" which was followed by the usual hoots and whistles. At this point I stopped listening and went to help a customer with a handbag. At some point these kids decide to venture out into the women's department and begin getting rowdy again. Their shouting could be heard all across the store, they were pushing displays and racks around to block aisles, and finally they began throwing things (clothes, water bottles, phone cases) until I finally approached them and tried to speak to them. They ignored me the first few times I spoke and then nearly hit a woman in the head with a travel mug and I lost it. I shouted very loudly \"clearly you're having a good time but you're gonna stop cutting up in my store or you can leave!\" And then miracle of miracles their mothers appear from thin air to call me a racist bitch and tell me I have no right to speak to their children. THEN they said I needed to apologize to their children for being harsh. Yes clearly the problem in this whole situation was me.",

        "content": "Did I do the right thing?\nBackstory: I've been struggling with my mental illness for awhile now and as a result I've called off work at my retail job a lot recently. We go by a points system, so a call off on a weekend is 2 points (despite asking for other days I've been scheduled weekends almost exclusively) and In the past four months I've been doing poorly.\n\nMy boss informed me I was over my point limit and since I was already mentally unwell I kind of freaked out. My boss (jason) will often ignore texts when he doesn't want to give bad news and I got hysterical, so I was kind of up his ass wondering what the hell to do. He shot me a few messages back.\n\nI get the points thing, and I have no problem with it (although it was never brought up to me and depression doesn't care about points anyway.) I can't exactly get a doctor's note from my trauma therapist explaining 'hey she's locked herself in her room because she's paranoid her mom is secretly tracking her location'. I digress.\n\nWe had the following conversation via text, and the only reason I didn't quit on the spot was because I was already out of control mentally but I do not tolerate shit from higher ups, normally one strike and I walk, but he got away with this one since i was sick.\n\nIn hindsight I wonder if I really did the right thing here. I mean, I've sent texts without thinking before, and maybe he didn't think it through. Plus I was bothering him on his day off (Which I didn't realize but still) so he was probably pissed.\n\ntl;dr Boss texted some disrespectful shit and I snapped.\n\nDid I do the right thing? (Also the hr thing was simply to make him stop talking to me, I don't trust HR as for as I could throw it.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3aharvw8m5d31.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=be642cc7ceccd2538b0560449cd67c77647a3ad7",

We have signage posted saying one person at a time, and markers outside that are 6 feet apart if there is a line. SO this one lady comes barrelling through the doors, even though there was another lady waiting for her drinks (who walked outside to properly social distance like someone with a brain) and the Karen that came in said \u201cwhy is there a table blocking the cafe?!\u201d To which we politely explained our system. So she asked for her drink, we put it on the table, then she opens the door, takes the lid off of her beverage and proceeds to lick the rim and take the sloppiest sip I\u2019ve ever seen. My manager was watching this, and then the Karen asked her to put whip on the mocha because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see any\u201d even though the drink was an hour old and the whipped cream melts. So she asks us to fill it. To which my manager says \u201cwe can\u2019t do that, you\u2019ve already taken a drink of it\u201d and Karen proceeds to LOSE HER MIND. So my manager puts more whip on it, and the rude lady leaves. Everyone in the store was in shock, but then the lady outside came in and said that we were doing an amazing job, and that we didn\u2019t deserve the abuse we just took. This Karen was one of about 12 we had today, but she was the first, and the most annoying.\n\nTLDR; Karen doesn\u2019t follow social distancing, gets mad at us for taking precaution",

So today, they made us do a few activities like baseball, introducing ourselves, dancing, and an activity where we had to ask two kinds of open ended questions. Customer service open ended questions, and friendly open ended questions. For the customer service questions, I put \u201cwhat couldn\u2019t you find today?\u201d \u201cWhat brings you in today?\u201d \u201cKind of outfit are you looking to build?\u201d And etc. For my regular questions I put regular stuff like \u201cPepsi or coke?\u201d \u201cWhat motivates you to keep going?\u201d And \u201cWhat are your passions?\u201d Another group had questions like \u201cwhat would be the first thing you would save in a house fire?\u201d And the manager preferred the group because the questions were more \u201cfun\u201d. And now I feel like my personality just isn\u2019t good enough for the job and I feel basic. I milly rocked in front of the manager and the whole group for Christ\u2019s sake.

It's in a stationery/gift/souvenirs type of a store in a large mall.  \nI earn less than 4 effin dollars an hour.  \nOne of the perks of working there is that after 3 months period, any employee can get 30% off any of their purchases.  \nNow onto the story. It was a kinda busy day, one of those where our profit was way more than we had expected, which meat that we had a lot of customers. Why I am mentioning, this is because if an employee wants to buy something, we usually wait for the store to be empty. It was about 10 minutes before my 12-hour shift ended. I was tired, hungry, and fucking done with people for the day.  \nIn comes an entitled bitch (EB). She was one of those people you just know are going to cause problems. Anyway, I just greet her as I am supposed to and am ringing a customer up. She wanders around the store, puts a few items in her shopping basket, and just looks around.   \nMy shift ends. I go to our changing room, grab my shit, and go to buy a few things I needed. I have those things and go to the cashier. She starts ringing my stuff up when I noticed the EB is behind me. If I wouldn't' be halfway done with the transaction, I would just wait for her, but as it was, I just prayed to God that she would not act up.  \nMy friend finishes at this point and uses a special card that will give in the 30% off.   \nAt this moment, I can feel the furry burring to the back of my head. She is furious but says nothing. She probably was waiting to see if she would get it off as well. Of course, she didn't.  \n\"Oh, there must be a mistake. It can't be that much. Can you make me a better deal?\"  \n\"Do you have our customer card?\" (special deal for those who shop with us often)  \n\"No.\"  \n\"Then sorry, but no.\"  \nShe flips out.  \n\"Are you fucking kidding me?! You gave this little girl a better deal!\" (I am 22, AND look older)  \n\"That is true, but she is an employee.\"  \n\"That is ridiculous; I am a customer!\"  \n\"I know.\"  \nAt this point, I walk out of the store and flag down our security guard, who was thankfully near. I know there is going to be more trouble incoming the moment I walk back in. EB Is red, fuming. She cusses all of us how is it possible that this bitch (she meant me) is getting lower prices than her, how she is a very important person, and she knows our boss (couldn't say his name and when we informed her our boss in a woman she started cussing again)  \nThe commotion was loud, and other security guards came in. EB Flings herself at the fucking cashier. EB gets rammed down by one of the security guards and is basically dragged out of the mall, into a waiting police car. (no idea who called them)  \nThe cashier is okay. Security guards are behaving like children on an early Christmas. (They don't get much action) I am baffled.  \nThe best part? She wanted to buy one pen. The price? 0,20 dollars.",

And given my experience with my current company (an unconventional grocery chain) few of the major competitors are willing to hire me for a similar position. \n\nMy wife works full time but in a career that does not make alot of money. I am the majority source of income at home. We bought a house 2 years ago that I will say was not cheap. Unless we sell the house I cannot take much of a pay cut in another career. At times I resent my wife for not making more money. Although I keep those thoughts in my head it's still not fair for her. \n\nI'm just at my breaking point. Any suggestions would be helpful. But if not I do appreciate taking the time out to read this.",

        "content": "Stores Closing and Hours Cut- Where will employees go?\nI know I am not the first and will not be the last to complain about  hating shopping online and the mass closure of stores.   Here is my gripe. I am a social worker and I assist clients with securing work . Retail was a go to for me for my clients- whether they were looking for full time work or part time. Also given the hours of retail many clients could go to school and work. Now so many stores are closing  and stores that are open are cutting hours to minimal staff. The bigger stores like Walmart and Grocery Stores are turning to those self pay registers which is ending jobs for cashiers. I am not delusional in thinking that someone could live a rich life working retail but many people have  made careers from it..starting as cashiers or in the warehouse and moving up to management positions. My brother has and he makes  about 50, 000 an year with no high school diploma. Also retail has assisted families who needed additional income. Now Amazon and similar sites have taken over..we all know even Wal-mart can wag its finger at Amazon for how poorly employees are treated and that says alot! I am concerned about the future for our children and what opportunities will be available. My brother should have finished high school but didnt due to struggling with mental illness in his 20's.. once he was able to stabilize himself he secured a job at a retail chain and worked his way up to Supervisor- he was not ever afraid of hard work and he did work HARD in retail but now he owns a home and supports his family. What will we have to offer a person in a similar position in 2020 and on? Some contract work with no benefits?  Rant over..maybe I just have to give it time for this change and economically it will all work out in the future.",

        "content": "Please help with work catch22!!!!\nHello! I'm currently struggling due to a very overcomplicated situation at my work. Any advice? (quite a long scenario):\n\nI was meant to be interviewed on a set date for a promotion to supervisor at my work (increase in pay and hours) when my manager told the team she had been planning with our district manager (big boss) to go on sick leave for a month, starting the week of my interview. I was left to run the shop on a secondment (temp 3-month contract) as supervisor without training or support, with cover managers that didn't know how to run the shop and with a member of staff quitting on the spot leaving me severely understaffed. I was promised an interview to make the position permanent at the end of my 3-month secondment.\n\nI also study for a masters degree and I am currently writing up my dissertation, as you can imagine this surprise step-up to supervisor has been a LOT for my mental health (i suffer from depression, anxiety, and OCD), and trying to survive uni alongside has been almost impossible. I am not doing very well at all and am desperate for time for myself as well as time to finish my (expensive!) degree. \n\nI've now been told that because another employee has complained that the interview he had for a previous role was conducted unfairly, my interview needs to be moved to next week, a train journey away, with a completely different member of staff AND a notetaker. I was informed of this when I went in to see my manager to request time off for sickness leave due to my ill health, and I was told if I was unable to attend the interview then that would be it, the date could not be adjusted or pushed back until after my dissertation deadline despite how hard I worked to keep the store open. I've been nominated for an award, told my hard work was vital to the store and told by management that they want me to have the job - but I'm now being told despite all this work I can't interview for the role because I'm sick?\n\nI mentioned the word discrimination today and everything changed: management said they'd rearrange the interview for me, change things around, etc. But I am really disgusted by the way I have been used by this company. I've worked here for two years and in the last few months have been royally screwed over with overtime, last-minute shifts, audits I wasn't prepped for, etc. I keep getting apologies and being told that I'm wanted, but also being told by staff that they'd understand if I left because I've been treated so poorly. I am at a wit's end.\n\nI was backed into a corner and told I could either withdraw my application because of my mental illness or attend the interview and make my mental much much health worse. To clarify, I have expressed that I am suffering from /extremely/ poor mental health to my manager.\n\nThe way I see it I have three options:\n\nQuit my job and work on my dissertation so I don't fail, but have no income and struggle to make rent.\n\nTake sick leave until I can get a new job  and so I can get my dissertation finished but have to dick around with a doctors note, phone calls, interviews whilst writing for uni etc.\n\nStick it out and suffer, put in a formal complaint and get some sort of justice, but feel forever bitter and hate my workplace intensely.\n\nTLDR: I've been told I can't go for a promotion bc I'm too unwell to attend a scheduled interview - told can't reschedule, then told can reschedule - all because another member of staff has complained about unfair interview practices.",

Honestly if you like retail, I think store level management is probably one of the safer positions in the whole company from a job security standpoint.  Basically you're the highest paid person that is still customer facing.  So it's hard to put store managers on the chopping block when payroll cuts need to be made.  They'll make you cut everywhere else, but your check will be the same every week no matter what.  \n\n\nFrom a \"every other\" perspective, you just need to decide if you like the work enough to make a carreer of it, and also keep in mind that nothing is for life.  There's nothing saying that once you get a few years of management under your belt that you can't make the jump into other things/fields.",

        "content": "Advice please and I need to vent. I have worked in retail for over 20 years and I feel like I am trapped in some dystopia when it comes to work options.\nHere is my story and I am just letting it rip out. Hopefully it makes sense and it definitely has the context of retail and how I need help finding work.   So here it goes \n\nI am in my late 30s.  I have three children.  My older two children are autistic fraternal twins and I have full custody of them. I am absolutely there main care taker and there world.   Ideally to maintain my time with them  I am looking for something part time.   \n\nMy options are so slim and the pay is so incredibly low.    That is why I am posting this here to see if anyone has any suggestions.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and I have over 15 years sales experience.   The jobs I find are seriously around $11 an hour with virtually no commission.    \n\nMy older kids go to the other parents house for the weekends so I can work Thursday through Sunday and only need an after school program on Thursdays.    \n\nMy other option is finding day care for 3  to 4 days a week and finding a more Monday through Friday job but even with that I am not sure where to go.    Plus it would break my heart to spend so much less time with them.  I sincerely value my relationship with them versus making larger amounts of money.   \n\nI just want to find a reasonably well paying part time job.     I would be a landscaper if it paid the bills.   I don\u2019t mind what work I do really.   I am clean and in great shape.  I am ready to get back to work.  \n\nMy recent previous experience has mostly been in the Wireless companies like ATT, Verizon and T-Mobile.   I had an interview today for a position with a T-Mobile indirect and the pay was  $11 an hour with maybe a $500ish commission check once a month.  Working 30 hours a week that would come out to a take home of around $1000 to $1100 a month.    I am sorry even with receiving child support and renting a room out of my house  I can\u2019t live off $1000 a month.  \n\nI am trying to be realistic.  I am not trying to find some part time position that pays $50,000 or $70,000 a year.    $25,000 a year and I can break even on my bills.   If the job is commission or not I need to make at least $18 an hour and ideally I want to find a position making closer to $25 an hour.  I would be in an okay comfortable place taking home $2000 a month after taxes.   \n\n I worked for ATT corporate almost 20 YEARS AGO and my hourly was $13.50 an hour and T-Mobile is offering $11 an hour.     It is my fault for not getting an education or finding a better career path with some sort of technical trade.  I did truck driving and even had a CDL at one point in my life.  I have always had so much going on in my life with virtually no family or friends.   Retail has always been the best option.  \n\nI worked for Verizon for a lot of years and they pay was well but after 8 years of being a sales rep it stopped working out.   They are a super stressful company to work for.  \n\nI tried being a real estate agent for 2019 and I could not produce any transactions which meant zero pay.  My \u201csphere of influence\u201d is loner small.     I would have loved for real estate to work because I sincerely love it but I could not get anyone to work with me.  I tried with countless open houses and gave up .   So here I am back at trying to find a retail job.  \n\nThis type of stuff probably belongs in r/collapse.   In 2001 I worked for ATT and made $13.50 an hour plus the commission I remember being closer to $1000 a month and now 20 years later companies like T-Mobile and Charter are offering $11 an hour plus the range of a $500 commission check.   I am just beyond frustrated.    Two decades later the pay is less in a lot of cases.  To me it is just bizarre.    \n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do for work.  I have a high school diploma and my main background is in retail sales.    I have a beautiful resume.  Over 15 years experience in commission sales and I am completely lost in what to do.  \n\nI wound even apply for management retail positions and see about day care for my kids  but everything I see online is entry level.    I don\u2019t see many options even looking in this direction.  Looking online is troubling with how many spam job listings there are.   \n\nSo if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions please send them my way.",

On Indeed you can filter through all the job postings to find something that fits your needs, like wage, salary, and hours. If you upload your resume to these sites it allows people looking to hire to see resumes that fit the position, and they occasionally contact you, but only get your contact info if you accept an interview, so no need to worry about scammers. If you are unsure about a company or posting, there is an awesome employer review section for each company which has past/current employees giving their opinion of being there.\n\nMight be a Canadian company, Im not sure, but i have not seen many spam/scam job postings.\n\n\nHope this helps at least a little bit!

The company is in a current state of influx and many seasoned employees are leaving. Reataffing the stores has been difficult to say the least and I'm still missing people in key positions. \n\nI dread coming in every day. The store is clearly struggling but there is so much going on I cant keep it together all at once. I end up getting less done because I'm worried about trying to get everything done. I feel defeated every day. I just cant take it anymore. \n\nI've been looking for other work but it hasn't gone anywhere. I have my bachelors in criminal justice but am having major difficulties finding work that will pay a similar wage given my work experience. I'd love to get out of retail but it seems impossible without taking a major pay cut. And given my experience with my current company (an unconventional grocery chain) few of the major competitors are willing to hire me for a similar position. \n\nMy wife works full time but in a career that does not make alot of money. I am the majority source of income at home. We bought a house 2 years ago that I will say was not cheap. Unless we sell the house I cannot take much of a pay cut in another career. At times I resent my wife for not making more money. Although I keep those thoughts in my head it's still not fair for her. \n\nI'm just at my breaking point. Any suggestions would be helpful. But if not I do appreciate taking the time out to read this.",

        "content": "Stores Closing and Hours Cut- Where will employees go?\nI know I am not the first and will not be the last to complain about  hating shopping online and the mass closure of stores.   Here is my gripe. I am a social worker and I assist clients with securing work . Retail was a go to for me for my clients- whether they were looking for full time work or part time. Also given the hours of retail many clients could go to school and work. Now so many stores are closing  and stores that are open are cutting hours to minimal staff. The bigger stores like Walmart and Grocery Stores are turning to those self pay registers which is ending jobs for cashiers. I am not delusional in thinking that someone could live a rich life working retail but many people have  made careers from it..starting as cashiers or in the warehouse and moving up to management positions. My brother has and he makes  about 50, 000 an year with no high school diploma. Also retail has assisted families who needed additional income. Now Amazon and similar sites have taken over..we all know even Wal-mart can wag its finger at Amazon for how poorly employees are treated and that says alot! I am concerned about the future for our children and what opportunities will be available. My brother should have finished high school but didnt due to struggling with mental illness in his 20's.. once he was able to stabilize himself he secured a job at a retail chain and worked his way up to Supervisor- he was not ever afraid of hard work and he did work HARD in retail but now he owns a home and supports his family. What will we have to offer a person in a similar position in 2020 and on? Some contract work with no benefits?  Rant over..maybe I just have to give it time for this change and economically it will all work out in the future.",

Really tired.   So, today I decided to pursue my sewing and costuming passion, and quit my job.    \n\nI can't devote the time I need to get an inventory going while working, so there you have it.  I quit.   I'm nervous.      \nRetail isn't that tough, but there are aspects that are completely thankless.    I know for me when I feel angry at a customer, or that the Company is just screwing me over that it's time to go.   It's me that has changed, not the business.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will be my first Thanksgiving that I can enjoy in 25 years.   My first Christmas Eve in 25 years.   No more working a stretch (open to close) because someone has the sniffles.   No more getting home at 11, and having to open the store at 8 AM.      Yeeeeeep feels pretty awesome.  \n\nUPDATE:  it's been a year, and freedom is sweet.  Get out of retail.  Get out!!  You will thank me later!!",

I worked in retail for 4 dreaded years, don't get me wrong there were so many great people I worked with but the constant abuse from customers for something that wasn't your fault and being bossed around by 9 people telling me 9 different ways to do a certain job just get's tiring. I worked in a range of different Cinemas over these 4 years. \n\nUntil, one day I had enough and realised it wasn't the life for me so I took a risk as much as everyone was against it, It did pay off but you really have to take the risk if you want to get out of retail. There's that picture that always sticks with me with retail being the big hole between you and reaching your life goals. I just want to say if you aren't happy pursue your dream because I know if I would have stayed at the Cinema, I probably would have gone right back after I graduated. \n\nAll I'm saying is don't be afraid, if you want it that badly, leave your job and pursue it. I managed to get a job in Marketing with no prior experience mainly through my knowledge that I taught myself and my passion for the area.\n\nAnyone else on the verge of leaving retail?

        "content": "I would like some advice on opening a Consultancy Firm (not for the traditional reasons). Any advice would be really appreciated!\nHi everyone, sorry this is a long one and I thank you in advance for taking your time to read this.\n\nSome background info about myself: I (24) am working for a company in Ghana at the moment as a business development & innovation specialist, in addition to majority of our UI/UX design work. I have been in charge of different projects to drive, come up with and promote new products, and help the business improve in any way possible. However I am planning on leaving this job in December. My aim is to work for my father's company after leaving. Thats where it gets a bit complicated.\n\nThe reason I am leaving my current job is because I feel like I've learned pretty much everything there is to learn from my current working environment and there is not much room for me to grow. I do not feel like I am being challenged, and at this point in my life I want to be using my potential and energy as much as possible. I also don't like the way the company operates. I have been with the company since May 2018.\n\nMy fathers company is a conglomerate that deals with many different types of industries, such as IT Infrastructure, Renewable Energy, Security & Surveillance, Transportation Management etc. As such there are a myriad of projects that keep coming up.\n\nThe thing is, my fathers company is not just his, it is jointly owned by him and his two brothers. Thats the way my dad set everything up from the start. Because of this, my father has been reluctant to let me join the company because he doesn't want there to be any family-business issues in the future, because we have been through issues with some other family business (from my grandfathers time), so when it comes to family and business, my dad is very sensitive.\n\nThis got me to thinking creatively and I think I found a way to get around this issue. I can set up my own consultancy firm and work for my father's company as an external resource on specific projects. This way, I am not tied to the company in any way, and this will avoid any of the issues that my father raised. My main job would be business management consulting; there's already a company my uncle wants me to take charge of and drive the business. From there I would be allocated different projects/products that need improvement.\n\nAdditionally, I can build a portfolio of the projects that I work on with my fathers company and in the future open myself up to actual clients.\n\nI haven't suggested this arrangement to my father yet, as I want to be very prepared before initiating the convo. I have spoken to my uncle about this and he thinks it's a solid plan. I have also spoken to a few friends of mine who gave me some suggestions, such as opening the firm in the UK rather than Ghana (I am a British citizen so this would be fairly easy for me). This way I build a better reputation being established in the UK rather than Ghana.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n* What do you think of this arrangement? Am I thinking in the right direction, or do you have any better suggestions?\n* What does it take to start your own consultancy business?\n* Anything I need to keep a lookout for if I want open it in the UK? From a legal/tax perspective?\n* If you've had experience in this field, what tips can you give?\n\nAny suggestions & comments would be very much appreciated. Sorry for the long post.\n\nThanks a million.\n\n\\-Lulu",

I started working again full time (W2 Contractor) while also being aggressive and earning my own independently (1099 Contractor).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, I've been studying more game from yall and recently setup my legal LLC, and procured checkings and lines of credit (for shits and giggles). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been in this W2 position for almost a year at a rate of \\~$65/h. \n\nI've been doing most 1099s at $75 an hour. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy liaison/agent to the firm emails me congratulating, that the client praises me, and also my contract recently got extended (which is a big deal at this company in particular). I say nothing in return, as I didn't want them to have an emotional edge on me in this negotiation I'm preparing for now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to ask for a rate increase as I'm approaching a year. I just don't know how to go about it, or even go about it in this contract positioning. I would like to ask for $65 -> $80 an hour, will settle if it's a corp2corp deal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel that I have a lot of leverage going into asking. The account is starting to get shaky with my agency. Their point of contact at the company is leaving. I'm a rockstar. I already have made it clearly known I'm a contractor, not full time employee - which means I don't have to kill myself mentally staying on campus. I've been delivering consistently for the past year.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to get some insight into this from the experts. The client is the #1 company in their industry; domestically.",

I am rather young and I came from two years in industry into consulting earlier this year. I had a flying start, but this set really high expectations and got me involved in some contract defining initiatives. After feedback from my manager from people I report to in the team a recurring theme was \"does not take ownership\" and \"does not perform with confidence\" and \"doesn't ask critical questions\". The first one comes from me becoming the \"do it all\" guy and I am part of too much in the program at the client. The two last ones comes from me feeling like I do not belong in a lot of these meetings with directors and legal at the client yet and I don't feel comfortable challenging internal or client senior directors because I literally do not feel like I can contribute anything meaningful in most of those discussions.\n\nMy manager told me you came in here like a rockstar, you got a huge opportunity to perform, and wasn't able to fully benefit. Manager now wants me to go to a new client, where the role is much more defined, and is what my actual position is set to do and where my competence lies. A long term \"safe\" role, with a more mature program, client and project. The team with the old client still wants me and I am getting poached to extend, but idk because my confidence at the old client the last month has been absolute shit. \n\ntldr: being given an opportunity to do something great, yet not being able to deliver fully. anybody have experience with similar situations? or just have some good words",

I had a situation where I was selected to interview for a shift management position. I didn't interview well. Some of the questions needed confident answers. I just wasn't showing the confidence and it resulted in them looking at another candidate. I definitely learned from the experience and the me today would have gotten the position. Also everything is not for you and things happen for a reason. You never know what life is protecting you from. I don't think I would have liked the position as manager because it was very demanding physically and mentally. These people literally made their life about that place and I would have been sucked into the same funnel. So Im thankful I never got that gig. I actually moved on to something more suitable and down the line I became a general manager of a small cafe. Another learning experience but the best job I ever had. Never would have got that gig if i was at the fast food place as a shift manager so I see how the events led to me learning the lessons I needed which actually prepared me for something greater.",

        "content": "Help from anyone in healthcare/biopharm consulting in determining a rate\nHi everyone, I was looking for some insight into a realistic consulting rate for a specific role.\n\nBackground: RN with 13 years heavy clinical experience, master's degree (in nursing) will be complete in 6 months. \n\nI am being offered a contract consulting gig with some fairly regular work- at least a week of work per month. (I will continue to work clinically half-time). The role is a combination of a nurse educator role and a subject matter expert for a consulting firm who helps device and pharmaceutical companies with usability testing. \n\nI have branched out into consulting already in the last few years and have done plenty of work as an expert for attorneys regarding nursing malpractice. My rate for this work is 5x my current hourly nursing rate (this is after raising it each year at the encourgament/urging of others who are familiar with this market), and I am still told I could charge more- so rates will go up yet again when I complete my master's. For some reason, when initially considering this position and what I would ask for, I put it in the box of my current clinical work, thinking of it as solely an educator type of job. I realize it is contract, and as most educators in my area (Northeast US) average about $50-55/hr in a benefits-eligible full time job, currently as a per diem RN make $50/hr, I was initially thinking in the 60s would be fine. I also have done some subcontracting nursing task assignments (simple stuff, case management sort of work) for $55/hr. So, stupidly, this range was in my head without really considering the total scope of work, my overhead, taxes, etc- even though this is the way I approached my other consulting work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of this interview they say we just need to determine a rate and then everything is great to move forward- being that this is a different industry than legal, I hadn't considered that my rate should be similar to what I charge for that, and not having thought it through totally- I eventually volunteered I was thinking in the 60s an hour. Thankfully the HR person more or less hinted that was too low- said there was no pressure to come up with a number now, and that the rate I suggested was \"very reasonable\" but that I could \"take some more time to research and think about it\" and make sure I am happy with a rate after accounting for taxes, etc.  Now that I am thinking about it, I realize of course I have to bring the rate up as this is on a contract basis, and is requiring more of my expertise, unique skill set and input than I originally anticipated (more clear to me after speaking with the team and what my exact role would be) and is actually more akin to the expert consulting than the simpler  subcontracting work or even in-house nurse educator work. There will be a lot more of adapting to different projects and it will not be the same as working in the comfort of the same circumstances and environment, as in a nurse educator role. I still, however, feel reluctant to ask for as high as I do for expert work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any input on where the sweet spot is here? Does anyone work in this industry and have some guidance?\n\n&#x200B;",

In my former company, we estimated 60% overhead for each employee - if the employee had a salary of 5000 per month, she needed to be billable for at least 8000 per month in order for us to break even. This calculation was valid for the country / city / town where that company was located. You need to find out how much overhead you will have as a freelancer - your time for non-billable efforts (pre-sales, etc.), home office, car, insurance, taxes, etc. ",

                "content": "There are other costs such as you'll be paying more taxes as an independent:\n\n\\- Your company pays 50% of your payroll tax when you're employed, but you pay 100% when you're independent\n\n\\- If you're planning to do this long term, then you should incorporate, etc. which costs money--often a few hundred dollars plus many states have annual renewal fees/special corporation taxes that add up to hundreds of dollars per year. \n\n\\- If you have a tax accountant, they'll probably charge you more as a business than as an individual--and especially since you'd only be your own business  for a couple months this year, it means you can't spread that cost over the entire year.\n\n\\- Also setup a basic website, professional email (not just gmail), and get other systems in place (bookkeeping, invoicing, etc.). Many of those things are free/minimal cost, but you might be looking at 20-40 hours+ to get it all setup over the course of a couple months. \n\n\\- What you'll pay for 2 months of healthcare is probably more per month than the rate your company pays, so you can't necessarily put it as +/- $2k ...though that can get confusing, especially depending on whether you get just 2-3 months or 12 months. Also note that likely the insurance you'd buy for yourself is not as good as a company's...but then again if you're healthy it might not be such a high risk.\n\n\\- Lots of little contracts and other things you need to get started--and in the longer term, marketing budget/attend conferences, etc.\n\n\\- On the other hand, you can deduct some things like home office expense, etc. from taxes. Though for \\~74 days this year that's not gong to be a huge deal--will simply offset SOME of the above expenses.\n\nThose and other little issues would swing your estimates by a few thousand. But in my opinion, the more important question is: Do you want to be an independent consultant? Do you value having a lot of control over your schedule, less consistency in income vs. potential for more in the mid to long term (not to mention you own the equity in your company)? If you are looking to make more money in the next 2-6 months, unless you have all those clients lined up or almost lined up, it's likely you'll make the same or less--possibly working harder.\n\nHowever, if you want to do this for at least a year or more (I recommend plan for minimum 18 months to know if it's for you and see what your sales pipeline/average project income etc. are), then having a \\~74 day opportunity that gives you a similar income to your current situation is definitely a better way to start than to just quit your job with no clients lined up. But you really should immediately be looking for your next project(s) from day 1. Budget some time each week to do that--or to at least set the stage for a contract extension on this one. For 2-3 months and then going back to the corporate world, I don't think it's worth it unless you're really eager to leave your current job, or maybe if like you want to travel or take some extended time (1+ months) off, you could do that project and then take off. It might look nicer in an interview to say you had a challenging, lucrative independent project that expanded your skillset and allowed you to travel or whatever afterwards for some time. On the other hand, if you just quit your corporate job, do this 2.5 month project, and then go back on the job market, I think you'll end up with less money than you would have otherwise and it may or may not look good to the hiring manager. Then again, don't sweat it too much, if you WANT to do this other gig and you have a financial cushion, it sounds like a good way to test things out. Good luck!",

One of my main responsibilities is answering the office phone. I get a lot of calls from different people... some are service users in distress, some are people asking for information about the charity, and a lot of them are sales calls! I generally feel competent in my telephone manner and have no problem speaking to people from different backgrounds, calling with varied requests.\n\nMy problem is that the office I work in is very small, and my colleagues can hear everything I say on the phones. Being new is daunting enough but having to be the main point of contact for the charity for all external queries is really scary when I know that everybody is listening to me and potentially judging my performance as the newbie. I know that I would perform a lot better if I was taking these calls in a room by myself, but unfortunately that is not an option.\n\nI recently had my three month probationary meeting, and overall my feedback from my manager was very positive. However, he did mention that my telephone technique could do with some improvement. He said that sometimes I get flustered and lose my composure with callers and forget to ask for important details.\n\nI am painfully self conscious when on the phones and I always feel so anxious when the phone rings. I know what he is saying is true. Unfortunately this feedback definitely touched a tender spot for me. I generally take criticism reasonably well, but this criticism has really got me down and I can't stop thinking about it, because I have no idea what to do about it.\n\nHow do I become less self conscious on the phones, when now I know for sure that my manager is in fact listening to me? He basically confirmed what I feared. \n\nI don't see any way to move forward with this. I actually feel a bit annoyed with my manager as he didn't discuss any options for improvement. All he did was point out that I am doing it wrong.\n\nIf anyone has any tips for increasing confidence on the phones in a small office environment then I would be eternally grateful! Thank you.",

I worked on a very challenging and helpful project, but my former boss had been fired, and the new boss didn\u2019t know much about the project. I sent the below message asking for feedback and recognition. I made jokes about the watch to lighten the real reason I wanted the recognition- which was that other people had begun to take credit for my work and that I worked hard, so it hurt to not even get a thank you. Now I\u2019m worried it sounds like all I care about is the watch. I do want the watch as well - because I think it would help me manage my busy schedule a bit better in my personal/professional life, but I\u2019m worried I came across as superficial. Please help:\n\n\nDear X,\n \nI\u2019m a little embarrassed to ask, but at the same time, I\u2019m this close to qualifying for an Apple watch on Above & Beyond, and so here we are, lol.  I was hoping to gain your feedback on the NAM Resource file in Box that I created.  And if you think what I have put together is up to snuff, I was hoping I could ask if you wouldn\u2019t mind recognizing this? Initiating and leading this project from start to finish was a labor of love that took quite a bit of time and effort. To bring this to fruition, I: (Described work I did) \n\n \nI worked with almost every single person on the team to create this file. This was a big undertaking that I took on while already working quite a bit of overtime, but it was 100% worth it because I\u2019ve had great feedback from several of the NAMs about how useful it\u2019s been for them. I really love recognizing where something is lacking and working to fill a need. I\u2019m motivated by how it feels to know I helped someone, and that\u2019s a reward in itself, but I\u2019m only human, and an Apple watch is an Apple watch\u2026you know what I mean? \ud83d\ude03\n \nNo pressure either way, but if you do feel inclined, I would be so excited and grateful.\n \nThank you,",

        "content": "What do you think about setting up company email on your phone, with company restrictions/policies?\nMy company is fairly restrictive on how to access work email and protective of the company network (as they should be).  Normally, we had to access the company's VPN in order to access our work email.  So if I had to access my work email form home, it typically means starting up my work laptop (which is IT-compliant according to my company's requirements) and logging into the company's VPN (using the software which is set up on our work laptops) before I can then access my work email.\n\nI've heard employees could also choose to take their personal phone to IT and have it configured to access work email, but then it would be subject to company restrictions (such as apps you can install, etc.).\n\nToday I got an email saying we can now access our work email without using the VPN, and they provided some updated instructions for setting up work email on a mobile phone.  I was reading through the terms, and it includes things like this, that basically say the device can be subject to an audit of software running on it and remote wipe if they believe there is any threat to data security, etc.: \n\n1. **When your Device is connected to the company network or you are accessing Services on the company network, the company reserves the right to search, intercept and review both incoming and outgoing company email, company information stored on your Device, including any password protected or encrypted information and communications, and all internet usage through the company network, without providing additional notice to you or obtaining additional consent beyond this agreement and any other applicable company policies and agreements. In addition, company may investigate, copy and use information on your Device (including personal information) at the direction of a court, government agency or law enforcement agency, or when there is reasonable cause to suspect that there has been a violation of the company's Code of Conduct, Electronic Communications Guidelines or other company information security and computer use guidelines, or a violation of laws or regulations. If requested by company Corporate Security, company Legal, Internal Audit, HR Legal, or company Information Security, you must provide your Device for manual inspection and possible copying and use of its content.**\n2. Your Device is subject to standard company information management policies and procedures including, but not limited to, a remote \u201cwipe\u201d that may remove all stored content to the extent technically feasible. A remote wipe may be performed at any time as deemed necessary by the company. Examples of when a remote \u201cwipe\u201d may be necessary include, but are not limited to: employee termination, malicious code infection, lost or stolen device, or prolonged absence from the company. The company will attempt to selectively wipe only company content unless you request a full wipe or a selective wipe is not technically feasible. However, the company is not responsible for any non-company information lost as the result of a remote wipe.\n3. Your Device is subject to a software audit by the company on all installed software running on it (generally the software name, version, program file information, and license information), for purposes of standard company software audit requirements.\n\nI can understand they want to protect their data and network.  Generally I don't do anything malicious, but I feel like I don't want to set up work email on my phone for risk of them potentially doing a remote wipe, etc. of my own personal phone.",

I was training secretly at another location to take over the office manager position from a woman who was about to be fired and did not know. My coworker was actually promoted from one position to another, but not as high in authority as me, and I was hired from outside. She is dispatch and therefore answers to me.\n\nOK. So, it recently came out that she believed she was getting the office manager job. It only came out because accounts payable and accounts receivable and I all had a chit chat about odd behavior towards me. \n\n1) She saw that I was in a closed door meeting with the owner. When it was over, she came to my office to tell me how much trouble she thought she was in for an error she made (Which cost the company a fair amount of money) and said \"You know how it feels. You're in the same boat as me\". I dismissed it because well, I'm not. Turns out she hoped I was getting written up. I was not. Certain things are not for everyone's ears and that is why the door was closed.\n\n2) She told me that at Christmas everyone buys bottles of wine and hands them out to everyone in the office. I asked accounts payable how Christmas is handled and she told me \"Oh, some small token gift, if anything\". So, I told her what Dispatch had told me and she said \"That has never, ever happened\"\n\n3) She told me last week that owner wants her to train me on handling certain taxes. I told her \"Owner never told me that. I'd be happy to learn it, but we'll have to see what I have on my plate that day because he gives me a priority list every day and his needs come first\". Yesterday she reminded me and said \"I told you you have to do this\" I replied with \"I told YOU, it depends on what OWNER wants\"\n\n4) I was cross trained on something that she is also cross trained on on she got verbally abusive with accounts payable when it was announced that I would be covering it for a day. \"That's MY job! Why does she have to be involved in EVERYTHING\". AP promptly said \"Because she's our boss\". That was when she stated \"Well, I was SUPPOSED to be!!!\" Evidently, this made three people laugh out loud directly at her and AP told her that when dispatch had opened up AP had recommended that Co-Worker NOT be promoted because she was too volatile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo. Owner spends a lot of time in her office and I know she's running her mouth and dropping little sarcastic comments about me in some sort of attempt to sabotage my working relationship with him. Know how I know this? He tells me. Then we laugh and laugh. He has told me she is on thin ice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am doing the best I can to ignore her childish behavior. It is difficult. She has started making a point of coming in half an hour early just so she can be here before me, then loudly exclaiming as I walk in \"Oh, you're here. Finally\" as I punch in five minutes before my shift. So, I told her \"You are not approved for overtime so I expect you to clock in for the time you are supposed to be here\"",

My one coworker was so nice at first -- we bonded over our mutual love of fitness/exercise etc. I'm a fairly quiet person when it comes to work, but she is not. She constantly narrates her actions, or will often complain about things until someone else validates her...i.e. she will say how cold it is, over and over again until someone agrees with her. Or she will talk about how the rain sucks, and repeat the same phrase over and over again until someone says something in acknowledgement. \n\nShe takes fat burner pills and makes sure that we all know she's taking them and she's got the \"Chills and sweats\" from them. She often talks openly about how people shouldn't bring candy in, because she can;t control herself around it. She will take a piece of office candy, and tell us all what a piece of shit she is and needs to start dieting more, etc. And again, she'll repeat herself until someone gives her validation or acknowledgement of what she's saying. \n\nToday, she's stated 4 times just out of the blue that the year is over, the year is over, where did the year go...she can't believe its November....for a good 3 minutes before I gave an \"mhm\" to shut her up. \n\nRecently, she went through a pretty  bad situation with her boyfriend, which involved cops and her having a small breakdown at work. I comforted her through it all, and told her she can't go back to him after all this. Well she is back with him, and I am done giving advice to her. \n\nShe openly works on her schoolwork throughout the day, which I don't really care about, but again, she narrates how she doesn't have time for it, doesn't understand it, and then tells us all how she CHEATS her way through all of the work and tests....and she's so proud of it. \n\nShe says she's diagnosed with anxiety, which I completely believe because of her behaviors and overreactions to situations, etc. \n\nI've started bringing headphones so I don't have to hear her constant sighs and gruffs and whines, because when she's not trying to talk to us, she's constantly talking under her breath. \n\nI....I don't know what to do. Technically my work is phone work so the headphones are a little inconvenient. My other coworker is pretty good about just not saying shit to her, but we both had a heart to heart about her behaviors, and don't really know what to do. \n\nShe's been with the company for almost 6 years...while me and my other coworker are both less than 3 months. Every employee who has left, this annoying coworker describes as \"Weird,\" or \"Quiet\" or \"kept to themselves\"\n\nI think I understand why....what can I do? I can't talk to her like an adult because she reacts like a child to any constructive criticism (i know this from her meetings with my  boss...the girl is a crier over anything)....\n\nAny advice?",

She knitpicks about every little thing coworkers do that don't meet her high expectations. She looks for sympathy and validation any chance she gets. This woman had a temper with me once and tried to have me fired. I work in a busy tourest destination at an inne. She made a scene in front of guests. Started yelling, throwing things around in dining room and took pictures if how i set up breakfast buffet and sent them to our boss at 7 in the morning. Boss reassured her that she was over reacting and i was doing my job, but this woman quit answering her texts. So the boss ended up calling the frony desk and i picked up and she asked me what going on. I told her that the coworker is haveing another one of her meltdowns. Then I went and got her from the dining hall and told her boss is on phone and wants to talk to her. I walked up behind her as she is on the phone and over hear her tell the boss she understands and then proceeds to say well i cant talk to you with someone standing right behind me. Then she got off the phone to walk past me to walk back to dining room and she looked at me and said no wonder you are the way you are.  Everyone complains about her behaviours but we grown to accept it's how she is. Boss keeps her employed because ironically enough this woman kisses everyone's ass esp the boss. She will come in at a short moments notice if needed everytime. So she became an annoying asset. Annoying because she is so fake. I can't stand working around her bc i work third shift by myself and i see everyone all the time. And i like to get along with everyone and not talk about people. I personally get to see how fake she is. She will straight up talk garbage about a person then acts like she has nothing but great respect towards them to thier face. She tries to act like im her best coworker friend now when im around. She is toxic ooze that tries to ooze her toxicity on anyone that takes in her bullshit or even acts like they care the slightest.",

It took me years to get the guts to tell a coworker (Sue) how I effed up, after all involved parties had left our agency, and I still feel a little nauseated when I think about it, but it made Sue laugh so here goes. \n\nThe year was 1993 (or so), I was 20 (or thereabouts), and a temp. I had temped for this agency earlier in the year, so when they called me back to fill in for December, I was excited because I was familiar, even friendly, with most of the staff. (I would temp for them again before they finally hired me permanently.)\n\n The way our office did Secret Santa, we'd draw names and someone who wasn't playing, in this case Joe, would keep the master list in case of confusion, then the players would gift the person they'd drawn with small things like candy, ornaments, little toys, Dollar Store-type stuff, throughout the week leading up to the reveal party and the big $10 gift. I was called in to replace a temp who didn't work out. She had already drawn a Secret Santa name, so Joe, as list master, came and told me who I was supposed to get gifts for. He said, \"Your Secret Santa is Sarah.\" I was so excited, I didn't pay attention to the way he phrased it. Sarah wasn't just a high level muckety muck, she was one of my favorites, and I couldn't believe that I, a lowly temp, got to shop for her! I was thrilled and intimidated because Sarah was very sophisticated and refined, though always very kind and soft-spoken (to me anyway). I never saw an ounce of Karen entitlement in her, so while I'm sure she would have graciously accepted Dollar Store crap, I stretched my budget and tried to do better by her.\n\n However, there's a snag. I noticed that Pauline, our receptionist and someone else I loved, she practically mentored me during my temp assignments with this agency, wasn't getting any presents. I asked Pauline, in case I just wasn't seeing them because she was taking them home or something, but no, Pauline hadn't gotten a thing. I felt so bad for her for having such a crummy Secret Santa, but she made an excuse for her Santa saying maybe they didn't have money, or didn't understand the game.\n\nSo the day of the reveal party comes, and Sarah offers to host it at her house, which wasn't just in the nice part of town, it was up by the Governor's mansion! It was lovely! We were on our lunch break so after a bite of food and a glass of wine (except for me, being the only person under 21) everyone sat down  to exchange gifts. One person volunteered to start by handing their present to the person whose name they drew, then the recipient would reveal themselves by giving their gift, so it was like a chain, and everyone found out who everyone's Santa was. \n\nI was getting antsy because it was taking forever to get to Sarah. But then I noticed it was also taking forever to get to Pauline. A creeping dread came over me and my face began to grow very hot. The number of remaining Santas and recipients was dwindling, and all I could think was no, no, no, please God, no! This *can't* be happening! \n\nEventually Jessica got a gift, and she stood up and handed a gift to Sarah. Sarah gushed about what a generous Secret Santa Jessica was, how Jessica had spoiled her giving her 2 gifts a day, and the whole time Jessica looked at her with a total \"WTF are you talking about\" face, but she said nothing and sat down. By now, my face is so hot, it was probably as red as a Santa suit, and I was on the verge of tears when Sarah gave me her Secret Santa gift. As Joe had said, Sarah was my Secret Santa. However, he failed to tell me what he was supposed to: I was Pauline's secret Santa. Feeling like the world's biggest piece of shit, I turned to Pauline and handed her the package I'd intended for Sarah, apologizing profusely for being such a terrible Secret Santa. Thankfully, she was very kind, forgiving, and gracious. She assured me it was all right and she loved the gifts I brought for the party. I still felt awful about it and carried the secret for years instead of making excuses and throwing Joe under the bus. I didn't see the need to make him feel bad, or make Sarah feel bad that half the gifts she got should have gone to Pauline, or make Pauline feel bad if she found out Sarah got double gifts while she got none. Chances are they would have just laughed at the silly mix-up, like Sue did when I finally confessed, but at the time, I felt like a kid, a child, barely out of high school, trying to hang with the real Adults, and I couldn't imagine a bigger social blunder.",

It's been a pretty lonely experience because all my coworkers are older, but it's a really small PR firm so I'm usually working with two other women in the office. It's an open office and the whole dynamic just makes me uncomfortable because everyone is the same age but me, so I feel very separated from the whole team. I haven't been able to make friends since being here because I work 9-6 and then just go home and go on my computer again, since I have no energy to do anything else. \n\nI've just realized the dynamic of the office is really not good for me because it's basically silent, no one talks to me, and I just need more interaction or acknowledgement even. It honestly depresses me that there isn't more stimulation or excitement. We basically stare at our computers all day and then I forget how to actually communicate with a human being. But I also just feel like people don't want me to talk to them, which brings my self esteem waaaaaay down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, basically I'm doing this program called TAPIF in France in October, but that still leaves about 3 months to get through this. I'm not really sure how to get through this without any friends and basically no excitement in the office. Does anyone have any suggestions at all? I just feel like I'm stuck in my head all day and it makes me feel even worse about myself, just reminding myself my coworkers hate me. Ok sorry for venting and thanks in advance!",

That way you can learn about new things and it really helps pass the time! I also find that listening to podcasts makes me feel like I\u2019m in the room with the speakers somehow if that makes sense, which helps with loneliness. \n\nHang in there!

        "content": "What To Do About Noise Based Conflict Embroiling Our Office??\nSo the entire staff of our office (\\~40 people) were pulled into an impromptu meeting today. The idea was to address the growing tension in the office. This tension is due to three individuals and their noise based problems. The setup is an open office, with low cubicle walls, and four people to a cubicle pod. \n\nThese three people in question share a cubicle pod:\n\nPerson 1: Has been here for 15 years, and is the martyr of the company. She is also blunt, loud, snappy, and regards herself as a tough bitch that takes no gruff. She is angry because person 2 and 3 talk too loudly behind her\n\nPerson 2: Works with person 3, she has also been here for 10+ years. She has a large amount of medical problems, and is often overwhelmed with anxiety because of it. She is shocked there are any complaints.\n\nPerson 3: He's only been here about a year and works with person 2. Him and Person 2 talk to eachother to do their jobs and is extremely frustrated person 1 is angry and complaining. He has complained to HR about person 1 a couple times already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, person 2 and 3 are trying to stay quiet, but they have to talk to do their jobs. And this noise will frustrate Person 1, who is always so anxious that any noise will piss her off. We can't move them, or put one in an office. So what do we do?",

        "content": "I feel I'm being targeted\nI've currently worked just over 3 years at my current job (I'm currently 26). I have worked part time in waitressin/bar work/customer service roles since I was 17 and throughout further education. \n\nThis first full time job was great at the beginning (meant I could move out from parents and helped my mental health). But now I feel this job is a world away from 'what it used to be'.\n\nFrom the start, it took a good 6 months to pick up the job and learn (as with most jobs) but more so because this job is mostly producing reports and accuracy. \n\nOnly the start of this year, our boss has decided to do monthly performance reports for us individually. Jan and Feb for me were 'no problems' and 'high standard of work'. However, for March, my performance was described as an anomaly due to the amount of errors made (5 for the whole month out of 176 reports I'd completed). \n\nI was told I'd have a return to work meeting today (11th April) due to my absence being too high (sick 5 occasions from March 2018 to now). \n\nI explained to my boss that I believe the reason for more errors made us because of how much work is being imposed on me (sometimes up to 20+ searches allocated a day) and how this causes me anxiety as it is in my mind knowing that it needs to be done. Realistically, I know it would be impossible to have all this done, as each one can really vary in the amount of time it takes to do. Also more reports in total could also mean a likehood of more errors in general. She also is aware that another boss 'keeps going mad with allocations ie allocating an obscene amount to all of us EVERY DAY. This is the same person who sometimes emails me to phone and pay for a plan from our suppliers and sometimes I could literally be on the phone or its in my list to do I've made. I feel like it's micromanaging, condescending, it's not needed and she even uses caps locks in emails that don't even make sense half the time. I know for a fact if I worded emails the way she does, I'd get pulled up for it no bother. I got the whole 'you've been working here 3 years' statement which I said I know what I'm doing, it's the unrealistic amount and feeling of being constantly rushed which is affecting the quality and accuracy of work. \n\nI've made the boss aware of this now, but then she began to speak of my absences and through this, I learn that she believes that I wasn't ever ill. Her words were 'We all don't want to be here, all demotivated and nothing wil be changed here about it. I know sometimes you don't want to face the day, but you should be just getting your ass in here. A day at a time and it will get better'. \n\nI didn't know what to say, not only does she not believe I was never ill but also how I need to accept this is shit and that's it and should drag myself in when I had the serious shits, a full on panic attack or when I was puking my guts up. I managed to grit through this informal yet brutal catch up meeting, but in the last half hour of work today someone just gave me a weird look and it just tipped me over the edge of my current emotions tbh. So I went to the bathroom to cry for 15mins and I've been doing this almost twice every month. \n\nThis is the same boss who reacted to an email I sent by taking me aside in the boardroom. (happened December last year). \n\nIn our work, you're allowed to work through your lunch and leave and hour earlier. The policy is to let the bosses know what you're doing. So looking back, I guess I didn't word the email in the best way but I didn't expect the reaction I got. I emailed something along the lines of:\n\n'Hello (insert boss name), \n\nJust letting you know I'm going to work through lunch today so I can leave at 4pm. Is this okay? \n\nThanks, \n\n(my irl name)' \n\nShe reacted by raising her voice at me and saying 'how dare you send an email like that, I tell you when to leave, not the other way around!' \n\nI sat there and my good mood went to shit almost instantly, as I apologised and made it clear it wasn't meant that way. I'm not so good at wording emails like that. (especially since it would be easier just to ask you in person!) \n\nI had shit going on outside work and it was after this I went to the doctors to get antidepressants as I broke down crying in work at this. Also, I really hate when people shout at me as I believe this is a trigger from my upbringing and narcissistic mother. \n\nAlso, the office environment is open plan, but people rarely speak to each other. I feel quite isolated because our team was split across to office to mix in with other teams. Almost everything has to be sent in email, so again makes it seem unreasonable to go actually speak to a boss in person. I honestly feel like I'm being overworked, shat on for no good reason and they secretly wish we were all total robots. I feel anxious almost the whole time I'm there and it's horrible. \n\nI know I'm not the only one who feels like this in my workplace. Any opinions on this or people who can relate to my story? \ud83d\ude05 I feel like I'm going mad, upset and angry into the mix as well. Also feeling stuck and even though I manage it better now, it's beginning to take a toll on my mental health.",

        "content": "Pissed off (20F)\nI worked as an accounting staff. \nI tendered my resignation 2 months ago (5th Feb) to work until 31st March.  On 24th Feb we got a newbie for replacing me. I thought that it\u2019s supposed to be me who would be teaching her but end up the Manager let her assistant train her. So, during the time she learn, the assistant has also asked a lot to me about how my work\u2019s procedure as she was not handling my part yet she need to teach. Hence, the manager thought i was idling and just getting pay without working, in fact, its from her decision that make me idle around. \nOn 19th March, the manager talked to me and told me to work just until 21st March as the newbie has learnt almost everything. I was okay about it, but i asked to confirm about how they would pay me for my March salary but she said she confirm with boss first. The next day, i asked again with a low level intonation. She suddenly frowned and asked me \u201cdon\u2019t be too panic about that! I will count for you!\u201d\nHmmm okay. \nAnd then comes the last day of me in that office. \nIn the morning, manager asked the newbie to go in to her room, guess what she said. \n\u201c how your works going? Do ask more to Pat cos she is leaving today. Patricia is an irresponsible worker, so I didn\u2019t let her to train you. That\u2019s why i leave you with Julie (assistant). Don\u2019t imitate every bad habit Pat has, such as: 1. Going back home at 5.00pm, go back after a while, i do respect your loyalty. 2. After lunch time passed, you shouldn\u2019t be doing your own stuff anymore (ex: washing your bottle), you should maximize your working time.\u201d\n\nAnd then when we were having lunch with 2 other colleagues, and also the newbie ( she has joined us for lunch for like 4-5 days), the newbie told us about what manager said. And one of my colleagues just damn pissed off of the manager behaviour to never confronted me for any of my mistakes, nor do i ever left any of my works undone. They all can see about that. Yet she bad speaking of me to others that way. \n\nIn the end, they gave me my salary of full amount until the EOM, as its they asked me to stop working before my supposed date. \n\nSo, my friend posted a status: \u201cmake a good relationship even when you are having a farewell, you won\u2019t know how successful she will be in the future, chances are fate will turn until one day you\u2019ll be needing her instead\u201d\n\nYeah this status is quite obvious that its talking about that manager. \nSo the manager is insulted and asked other staff to tell my friend to not gossip. \nThey were supposed to be in a good term of relationship but because of this incident, this 39 years old manager just blocked both our IG, WhatsApp, and Facebook even though we were not friends \ud83d\ude02 also, she made my friend the admin of our office\u2019s group, and she ownself left the group. \nAnd we heard that she also posted a status said: \u201ckeep picking the wrong one, just like virus\u201d \n\nThe status probably means \u201ckeep picking the wrong staff, bad staff influence one another like virus\u201d\nWth hahaha don\u2019t be so childish, auntie.\n\nSo we both end up being enemy with this manager which we never intended to. \n\nI was so happy that i left that toxic place, which i never done anything wrong but seems like i never got welcomed there. Everyone seems to have their own group. If i happened to have any mistake, i think she should also tell me in person which she never did, and not to spread it to other people to degrade me. And she should also show some transparency of how she treats us employees, as she showes a lot of differences on how she treat her assistant Julie and towards others. \nMaybe this is just a part of my story. And she is just one of them to disrespect me, there is also her sister works there too, that always label me as \u201cpretty accountant\u201d and accusing me to have affair with a staff there whom the staff happened to be her crush before she knew that this guy is married. \n\nP.s: i am quite a timid person to be answering or complaining about what i felt or what people say about me. That\u2019s why my friend was so angry and put on the status. But i wished i was brave enough to answer them all tho!!!",

We\u2019re all salaried employees. I work outside of work hours ALL the time. And some of my coworkers, especially my boss, work a lot more than me. Just this past Sunday I worked for an hour at 10am and again for an hour at 4pm. Working on some extra stuff just to be helpful tonight and tomorrow night.\n\nSo what now?

Nothing wrong with that in some cases, but we work in a semi-formal office environment so dress for the job.\n\nComing in empty handed is also a red flag to me, I expect interviewees to be able to take notes if needed and have references/resume handy.\n\nAlso, I can't imagine someone bringing a friend a long for an interview (seriously who does that??), but that would also be a no for me.",

        "content": "Stop Devaluing the Wisdom of Teachers. Researchers Don't Have a Monopoly on Evidence\nThe drive to use evidence to inform action in education has an essential problem: the academic community's almost religious belief that scientific evidence is the only evidence that has legitimacy. We have arrived at the position where other sources of knowledge are not only devalued, they are rarely acknowledged. Scientifically valid knowledge is widely regarded in the education research community as the only knowledge worth having. A draft paper recently presented at a national conference asserted disapprovingly: \"Teachers do not use evidence,\" referring to the scientific variety.\n\nAs an academic who began as a teacher, I disagree. Such statements are not only arrogant, they are inaccurate. Dominant educational practices drawn from scientific research can be both wrong and damaging\u2014witness the long-held but now discredited conclusion that teaching children reading and mathematics before the age of 8 was a poor use of time.\n\nScientific evidence is not the only source of knowledge nor is it the source of knowledge that always holds high ground in decisionmaking. Two other important kinds of knowledge are what might best be labeled craft knowledge and moral knowledge.\n\nCraft knowledge stems from the understanding gathered over time by practitioners, including through stories, ad hoc observations, and intuition. It is the evidence that usually legitimizes professional judgment in our field, in part because scientific knowledge is not available or cannot be generalized to the thousands of different situations educators face daily. Another strength of craft knowledge is its encapsulation in stories, which are memorable and therefore available to guide action in the moment.\n\nRelated\n\nI have often seen this evidence ridiculed and dismissed by professors and policymakers. And yet what I consider the most valuable evidence I've encountered in my teaching career falls into the craft category. When I taught 1st grade in a poor, rural school in North Carolina in the 1970s, I had a tough little boy named Benjamin for a student. One day he appeared at the door of the classroom crying. \"Someone stole my 3 Musketeers bar,\" he snuffled.\n\nI was on the verge of seeing this issue only through my own eyes and my own understanding of the action: a missing candy bar. But some instinct made me listen instead.\n\n\"My father gave me that 3 Musketeers,\" Benjamin said, trying to sum up the meaning of such a rare treat in his young life. To try to match the weight of Benjamin's emotion, I spoke with the whole class, explaining what the loss of the candy bar really meant to Benjamin. We talked about \"hurt\" and how \"we\" had the ability to help Benjamin be happy again. When we returned to class after lunch and play time, the candy bar was back in Benjamin's cubby.\n\nThat lesson was perhaps the most powerful in my teaching career, and I've shared it many times with my students who are aspiring teachers. If you don't understand a problem from the student's point of view, you are not likely to be able to solve it.\n\nKnowledge from the real world of teaching has high influence. When teachers tell stories like Benjamin's to one another, they listen. What administrators bill as scientific knowledge, on the other hand, is often disappointing.\n\nTake my colleague at that school in North Carolina, Mrs. Wyatt. She was still using phonics to teach reading when I arrived at the school, but then a mandate came down from administrators: \"Use the whole-language approach.\"\n\nSo Mrs. Wyatt taped everything she needed for her phonics lessons on the inside of the double doors that closed off her closet. The doors were open when she taught reading, closed when she had administrative visitors. Eventually, of course, scientific research vindicated Mrs. Wyatt's approach.\n\nWhen such wisdom is raised up, research colleagues react as if their world has been turned upside down and their credibility challenged. They are in the business not of trying to investigate craft knowledge but to replace it.\n\nI have never seen a teacher or principal reject a story as legitimate evidence. That doesn't mean the stories are taken at face value. Counter-narratives often are offered because we should question how best to interpret evidence. But it is not, as routinely suggested, a matter of converting school people to the use of scientific knowledge. It is coming to recognize that scientific evidence does not and should not carry the greatest weight in many school situations.\n\nAnother type of knowledge, moral evidence, is rarely even acknowledged by the education research community. While ethical and equity considerations increasingly shape our profession, they are often conspicuous by their absence from researchers' understanding of decisionmaking in classrooms and schools.\n\nIf educators decide, in relation to disciplinary policy, that it is morally indefensible to keep children after school several days a week, their reasoning seems invisible to researchers. Ethical principles\u00a0as knowledge\u00a0are not allotted a seat at the evidentiary table even when they constitute the first and the ultimate test of a proposed course of action for teachers, principals, students, and parents.\n\nTo move forward, we need to see schooling through the eyes of others. When we do not, reform will fail.\n\nThe dominant question among researchers seems to have become: How do we get school people to use scientific evidence? This is, of course, a very important question. But it is not the right question with which to start.\n\nThe most important question is: How do we begin to acknowledge and use valuable evidence from all sources of knowledge to assist in the improvement of schools?\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/10/30/stop-devaluing-the-wisdom-of-teachers-researchers.html",

I'm one of the people in my year who has my shit together.\n\nOn the 30th they are having an open forum for students to voice their problems. I have been trying to change things for 2 years now. I'm done. I'm going to go their and take the piss out of them\n\nMy course has been shit since day 1. They constantly are disorganized. They have a woman who should be in retirement in charge of the organization of all the lectures and course structure. She's a nice woman but she can barely type 30wpm and her desk is knee high in papers. All the lecturers read from slides, they don't want to be there, the students don't want to be there, nothing of value is added in these lectures. The labs during year 1 and 2 were good, that was the only high point.\n\nThe course has no module selection options. I want to do robotics but I'm forced to do an INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE module. Where the prof tries to convince us ICE won't die out.\n\nIt's the 16th of October and somewhere around 30 - 40 students haven't been assigned a thesis/professor supervisor. They expect a 10 page project proposal and methodology with literature review by the 30th. Last year it was 2 pages. 70% of my course voiced up in a vote for an extension. Denied because \"you can do it in 2 weeks\" on top of a 9 - 6, 3 days of a week while learning 2 computer simulation software.\n\nThe mechatronics Arduino kits aren't enough for everyone, have to stay in the lab, and cost 60quid each. They couldn't even do a student count before the year started to make sure everyone had enough. Now first year product design students get a 70quid worth of kit TO KEEP. They can't even invest in us a little kit for us to actually learn with in our own space and time.\n\nThe new Head of Department is this old crone of woman. I was in my CFD labs, waiting for a sim to load, so I played a game of clash Royale on my phone. She comes in, not apart of the lab, and tries to rip the phone out of my hands then makes comments about how I'm going to be one of the ones asking for an extension. Completely disrespectful and unprofessional.\n\nThose are a few of the current problems in my year alone.\n\nI've talked with students from the same course in different universities in the UK. Ive looked at the structure in the US. They are scamming my fellow students out of an education that will prepare us to be real career working engineers. If there isn't module selection because variation is cost then the modules they offer should be of acceptable quality.\n\nThis university claims itself as an engineering university. I'm going to go and argue they are pocketing more than 70% of our tuitions. This is a mostly international uni, so they are making A LOT in tuition fees. I want them to open up their financial records. They need to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nThoughts? Disagreements? I need to be prepared to counter argue.",

I have had bad professors, but I have also had good ones who aren\u2019t to blame for the incredibly inconsiderate structure that exists for the curriculum. \n\nThe problem here is that coursework, at least until late junior and senior year, has nothing to do with engineering. It\u2019s all theory and math and science that no one is willing to give you a straight answer as to how you\u2019re going to use it. \n\nWith that said, I\u2019ve accepted that the coursework is almost worthless to me and sought salvation elsewhere. I joined the FSAE team at my school, and it\u2019s been the best time; intense design and engineering, teamwork, applicable research into mechanical principles, and all while getting to do it with students who give two shits about what they\u2019re doing.\n\nI think that to try to change a system that fails you is hard, and in most cases impossible. It would be more fruitful for you to make a system or find another one for yourself. Find a group that will prepare you, whether it\u2019s at your school or not. If you really care about being prepared for industry, do so. Employers will care more about how YOU fixed the problem in your life than if you got other people to do it for you.",

Since then, I collected tons of ideas and thoughts and even 3D designs of the school.. (I thought I maybe have asperger because I spent a lot of time watching videos about how schools around the world look like and building prototypes? Idk why I enjoy that so much) and until now when I think about it I feel adrenaline goes through my entire body (not exaggerating). I thought that when I graduate from high school I'll forget the whole idea.. but surprisingly now I'm in my last year in university and still have that and have a notebook where I write down my ideas.. about literally everything in this school starting from research center and disability-friendly architecture ending with curriculum and extracurricular activities and literally everything in between (like how to make a change in educational disasters like when almost an entire generation in Syria is not going to school or how provide good education to disabled children)\n\nBut.. simply I don't know what to do with that really insisting feeling that still comes to my mind for nine years now and I just don't know how to respond to it.

Where shall I start the whole thing?

Which being said, figure its not about needing to be taught many of those things, for most its about getting comfortable with the idea of needing to do those things. That is, past and beyond needing to have some imagination on how to adapt to changing environments. \n\n> People want to become doctors and engineers and do really amazing stuff.\n\nTake two guesses which types of knowledge you will likely be in dire need of if things really do go sideways.\nHow to diagnose and treat disease, how to rebuild stuff from scratch, how to process existing resources to have ends meet... so on and so forth. \n\nAs for the education being \"backwards\" i dunno most people who have multiple degrees leading up to post grad stuff will have taken all sorts of extra curricular coursework leading to a wealth of information they can rely on.(ceramics classes, geology, biology, etc...) The point of the education therein is that it is the means by which survival is accomplished thereafter it is also the means by which survival is improved on.",

        "content": "VTHS Administration cutting ITS program forcing students to move into other programs\nJust weeks into the new year all the parents were informed that the IT program was being cancelled and the children will be forced to move to other programs the children have no interest in.\nThe current teacher has been in the program for 20 years and had no idea the program was being cut. He did have issues going back to school in the hybrid program but has communicated with administration that he can go back in. \nThe school is all virtual now and plans to go hybrid on 10/5. The administration claims they must cut the program due to in person staffing problems. They say the program isn\u2019t big enough to hire a sub for in person. 13 children currently enrolled in the program. The VTHS is about 300 students with a large percentage in the medical field. \nThe families are shocked that the school is forcing all the students to go into different programs they have no interest in. Some programs the offered us was auto mechanics, graphic design, law and public safety, cosmetology. No my computer geek kid does not want to become a police officer or a hair stylist, thank you very much. Meanwhile the administration is lying saying they have not been in contact with the teacher even though they were emailing him last Friday. \nWhat can parents do? We are emailing County Freeholders, Board of Ed. Writing emails to the superintendent to not cancel the program and to work with the teacher. They are ignoring us. I think they just want this teacher out for some unknown reason and are using the pandemic as an excuse.\nThe administration\u2019s latest spin is they are closing the program for the year to revamp it and start new next year. So they are throwing away a year of every student\u2019s education in order to find a way to fire this teacher? There are second and third year students that love the program that are now being forced to take a year off. Who knows if this promise to restart this program next year is even true.\nI am a parent and I\u2019m asking the hive mind here for any advice. Thinking of going to the press. Ironic how the program to be cut is IT which is the industry that is keeping our society together in this pandemic.",

        "content": "More science apps I made for everyone to use for remote learning (or in person)\n*Hello reddit, It's the Wild Haired Science Teacher back with 16 new science apps and simulations. [Here's my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/i4wufs/with_so_many_classes_being_remote_i_wanted_to_do/) from last week in case you missed it. It explains a bit about who I am and what this is. (I'm a Chicago Public Schools science teacher who makes apps for his own classroom and want to share them is the short version.)*\n\n*First off, THANK YOU to everyone who wrote all the kind words last week when I launched. You have no idea how much your support keeps me going. Before posting, I wasn't sure if it was worth cleaning these up and sharing them, but the thought that I could be helping thousands of students leaves no doubt that I am doing the right thing.*\n\n*Also, thank you to everyone who offered to help or wants. I don't think I have the energy right now to expand but If I ever get there I have all your offers saved.*\n\nAnyway, here's what you are here for, the apps:\n\n\n## All Apps\n\nYou can see all the apps in one place, including the ones that I posted last week. \n\n[all apps](https://whscience.org) - [physics apps](https://whscience.org/physics/) - [biology apps](https://whscience.org/biology/) - [chemistry apps](https://whscience.org/chemistry/)\n\n## New Biology Apps\n\n[Bacteria Plate Streaking](https://whscience.org/streaking/) - **Biology** - Students practice the procedure of streaking a plate to isolate a bacteria culture. Heavy inspired by [this excellent simulation](http://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/content/streakplate.html) out of Michigan State University that unfortunately doesn't work well for remote learning because it requires  flash. A request of my wife's. \n\n[Transcription and Translation](https://whscience.org/transcriptiontranslation/) - **Biology** - Move base pairs around to transcribe off an open DNA sequence and then act as tRNA and bring in the right amino acid using a chart. I'm going to be honest. This app is so old I don't really remember making it but I tested it out and it seems to work fine. \n\n(Sorry, just two today)\n\n## New Chemistry Apps\n\n[Air Pressure Paper](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up. Text is huge because I used it on a projector as a whole class. \n\n[Light and Temperature](https://whscience.org/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. \n\n(Sorry, just two today but I have a friend who is asking me to make a several new high quality ones so there should be more chem soon.)\n\n## New Physics Apps\n\nI teach physics so most of what I have is physics. \n\n### Virtual Labs/Phenomena\nThese replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. \n\n[Air Pressure Paper](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up.\n\n[Ball on Ramp](https://whscience.org/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. I also have a version with friction that I use for my forces tests I will try to find. \n\n[Cannon](https://whscience.org/cannon/) - **Physics** - Cannon that fires a ball. You can change the power of the cannon and the angle of fire. Students use a ruler to measure the range of the cannon and a stopwatch to measure air time. There is a fair amount of randomness so students can practice more of the skills in analyzing and interpreting data. \n\n\n[Elastic Energy](https://whscience.org/elastic/) - **Physics** - Drag to stretch a rubber band. Shows the distance, force required, and elastic energy. I use this for practice describing patterns as linear and non-linear. \n\n[Measuring Gravity](https://whscience.org/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance.  \n\n[Light and Temperature](https://whscience.org/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. \n\n[Roller Coaster Motion](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Not new this week but a redditor asked for a [version where the cart rolls back](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotionrollback/) if it stops on the hill.\n\n[Storms](https://whscience.org/storms/) - **Physics** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy. \n\n[Wave Interference](https://whscience.org/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave. \n\n\n### Measurement or Problems\nThink of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. \n\n[cars](https://whscience.org/cars/)  - **Physics** - Three cars of different colors drive along a road. Students can time them and use calculations to determine their velocities. I also have versions with accelerations if people are interested. \n\n[Measuring Gravity](https://whscience.org/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance. \n\n[Measuring g on Moons of Jupiter](https://whscience.org/gonmoons/) - **Physics** - Students are given animations of a ball bouncing on four moons of Jupiter. They use a digital ruler and stopwatch to measure realistic values of g on each of the moons. I used it as a quiz where students were randomly assigned one of them and had to measure from the bottom to the top of the bounce and then calculate. \n\n[Wave Measurement Practice](https://whscience.org/wavemprac/) - **Physics** - The app generates a graph of a wave on a grid. Students practice measuring wavelength, amplitude, and number of waves. The app checks if they are right and keeps track of how many they have in a row.  \n\n### Diagram Makers\nSometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.\n\n[Stick Figure](https://whscience.org/stickfigure) - **Physics** - I use a lot of dynamic stick figures to illustrate a motion I am describing in writing. semi detailed stick figures with two-segment arms and legs can really help demonstrate what is happening. This app helps making them easier. \n\n[Two Wave Diagrams](https://whscience.org/twowavediagrams/) - **Physics** - Combines two waves and saves a png of the result. Waves can be combined with AM, FM, or with simple interference. AM and FM support square waves. Can change the wavelength, amplitude, and phase of each wave. Wavelength and Amplitude are in pixel units. For phase 1=-90\u00b0 for some reason.\n\n---\n\nThat brings the total to total number of apps and simulations to more than 30. I still have probably about 10 more old ones that need cleaning up and there are some new ones I'm working on (especially bio and chem.) When I have a bunch ready I'll post them to reddit but if you don't want to wait you can check [the live list](https://whscience.org) to see what's new. \n\n - Wild Haired Science Teacher",

        "content": "Universities Step Up the Fight for Open-Access Research\nFIVE YEARS AGO,\u00a0when Jeffrey MacKie-Mason first joined the University of California team that negotiates with academic publishers, he asked a colleague what would happen if he failed to strike a deal. What if, instead, he simply canceled their subscription? \u201cI was told I would be fired the next day,\u201d the UC Berkeley librarian says. Last year, he tested out the theory. The university system had been trying to negotiate a deal to make all of its research open-access\u2014outside of a paywall\u2014with Elsevier, the world\u2019s largest academic publisher. But they were too far apart on what that would cost. So MacKie-Mason\u2019s team\u00a0walked away.\n\nTo his surprise, the army of UC researchers who depended on that subscription were willing to go along with it. They\u2019d lose the ability to read new articles in thousands of Elsevier journals, sure, but there were ways to get by without a subscription. They could email researchers directly for copies. The university would pay for individual articles. And yes, unofficially, some would just probably download from Sci-Hub, the illicit repository where virtually every scientific article can be found. To MacKie-Mason, it was clarifying: The conventional wisdom that had weakened his negotiating hand was thoroughly dispelled.\n\nSince then, progress towards open access has crept along. More deals of the kind UC wants have been struck, especially in Europe. But in the United States, progress has been especially halting. Then, last week,\u00a0MIT officials announced\u00a0that they too had stepped away from the table with Elsevier, saying they couldn\u2019t agree to a deal. And now, University of California officials have announced their intention to make a deal with Springer Nature, the world\u2019s second-largest publisher, to begin publishing the university system\u2019s research as open-access by default. The deal starts in 2021 for a large number of the company\u2019s journals\u2014and puts UC on the path, at least, to do so for all its journals within two years, including its most prestigious ones, like\u00a0Nature.\n\nThe deal is, in many respects, an agreement to keep haggling. But in the open-access research world, it\u2019s a sign of long-awaited changes. Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of the California Digital Library, notes that the deal is poised to be the largest of its kind yet in the United States. Carrie Webster, vice president of open access at Springer Nature, calls it a \u201cblueprint\u201d for other US-based institutions.\n\n\nLots of institutions\u2014community colleges, research universities, city library systems\u2014pay so their members can read paywalled journal research. But only a few actually publish the bulk of it: big universities like MIT and the University of California. (The UC system alone\u00a0contributes about 9 percent\u00a0of published research in the United States.) Increasingly, researchers at those places want their work to be accessible to anybody\u2014for the good of scientific inquiry, to be sure, but also because they increasingly receive grants from funders that require it. (Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt that open-access work is more likely to be seen and cited by other scientists\u2014an important measure of status and influence.) But since journals can\u2019t charge people to access those studies, they charge researchers an extra fee to publish them. Often, the cost runs into the thousands of dollars.\n\nIn recent years, universities have pushed to flip that equation. Under so-called \u201cpay-to-publish\u201d models, like the one the UC system is entering with Springer Nature, the university negotiates the cost of making every piece of research it publishes open access. (That\u2019s opposed to the old \u201cpay-to-read\u201d subscription model.) Universities like UC and MIT are making slightly different demands in how that works. But they share common principles, says Roger Levy, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT who leads the university\u2019s library system committee. \u201cWe should not be paying for content from publishers that aren\u2019t in the business of producing that content,\u201d he says.\n\nFor advocates of open research, these sorts of deals are potentially a good step. \u201cIt gets us closer to an ideal where everything is open-access,\u201d says Michael Eisen, a geneticist at UC Berkeley and cofounder of the Public Library of Science, or PLOS, a major group of open-access journals. (He\u2019s not involved in the UC negotiations.)\n\nBut there are stumbling blocks on that path, Eisen notes, including the status of the most prestigious journals, like\u00a0Nature\u00a0and\u00a0Science\u00a0and\u00a0Cell. Those journals, which have large staffs and reject lots of submissions, are particularly expensive to produce, and publishers have long argued that the economics of making them open-access don\u2019t make sense: The fees to publish would be too high if they couldn\u2019t recoup their costs by charging readers.\n\n\nRecently, that wall of opposition has been cracking. One reason is pressure from agencies that give researchers grants, says Lisa Hinchliffe, a professor at the University of Illinois library. Influential funders including the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are behind a framework, called Plan S, which would ensure that all the research they fund be published outside of paywalls starting in 2021. Then there are signs of trouble in the subscription business model itself: preprints, which go up without paywalls and without peer review,\u00a0have grown in influence. And there are plenty of ways for researchers to circumvent the journal walls, as universities have demonstrated by canceling deals. \u201cThey\u2019ve recognized that gated access to PDFs is only going to work so well,\u201d Hinchliffe says.\n\n\u201cThe publishers have no choice but to reckon with this,\u201d Eisen says. And in recent years, they\u2019ve started to. A number of European countries, like the\u00a0Netherlands\u00a0and\u00a0Germany, have forged open-access agreements with Elsevier, Springer Nature, and others. So have a number of universities in the United States (including\u00a0California State University\u00a0and Carnegie Mellon University with Elsevier). Recently, Springer Nature officials said they would\u00a0sign on to Plan S\u00a0for all its journals, including the flagship,\u00a0Nature,\u00a0and gradually introduce more open-access content over time.\n\nSure sounds like progress. But in the long term, the math isn\u2019t so simple, Hinchliffe says. It goes back to the simple fact that some institutions, but not all, actually publish the bulk of the world\u2019s journal research. Over time, as more major universities switch to pay-to-publish deals, more work will be freed from paywalls. If enough big institutions do that, smaller teaching institutions\u2014the places where scholars just want to read research, not publish it\u2014will be able to cancel their contracts. \u201cBut I assure you they won\u2019t be sending their money to the big research university so they\u2019re able to publish,\u201d Hinchliffe adds. Either the big universities and their research funders will have to pay more, or the publishing industry will have to make less. \u201cEventually, this is going to be a major problem, and I think the major publishers are quite aware of that,\u201d she says.\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason these deals have been easier to broker in Europe so far. In European countries, research funding is more centralized, says Webster of Springer Nature. The company (and others, including Elsevier) have been able to hammer out country-wide deals in which it\u2019s possible to pull together different funding streams\u2014which is necessary, she says, to support open access in expensive journals like\u00a0Nature.\u00a0But in the US, where everything is patchwork, the company has to design ways to separately invoice different funders, institutions, and researchers to cover the costs of publication. Sounds bureaucratic\u2014and it is. It\u2019s also expensive to set up. Webster says the company hopes the bespoke invoicing system it developed will be useful when it works with other US institutions.\n\nOne potential side effect of all that: consolidation. One concern with pay-to-publish models is that big open-access deals could help big publishers firm up their grasp on the industry, and also shut out less wealthy institutions and countries from publishing. Hinchliffe points out that open-access publishing\u00a0is already more consolidated\u00a0than the industry writ large. \u201cScale just has its advantages,\u201d she says.\n\nThose factors contribute to why these current negotiations are so fraught. The deals forged between librarians and publishers will have effects on business models down the road, Eisen notes. Universities that publish a lot want to lock down deals with low publishing fees now, knowing that their access fees will eventually go away. Publishers want to find ways to plug up those drying revenue streams. \u201cMy answer to that is: Nobody says revenue should stay the same,\u201d Eisen says. \u201cThe solution to that isn\u2019t to just reapportion, but to decrease the amount of spending.\u201d Publishers currently make gargantuan profits off of this system. (Both Elsevier and Springer Nature have revenue in the billions and reported operating profits margins of\u00a037 percent\u00a0and\u00a023 percent, respectively\u2014on par with Apple.)\n\nIt\u2019ll likely be a hardscrabble fight to get there. But recently, at least, universities seem to be gaining a stronger hand. And it\u2019s coming with a broader recognition that open-access research is a valuable public good. One need not look further than the Covid-19 crisis, in which prestigious academic journals, long holding up their iron gates, decided (with some urging) to release articles related to the virus for free. (For the record, that\u2019s been WIRED\u2019s approach, too, with stories about the\u00a0health and science of Covid-19.)\n\n\nThat\u2019s enabled doctors in small-town America to read the latest health research without a subscription, notes MIT\u2019s Levy, and for data scientists to scrape massive troves of papers for patterns and insights. \u201cJust imagine if that were the norm, if that were just automatic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great illustration of where we should be for every problem in the world. Not just this one problem.\u201d\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s all temporary\u2014and limited. The promise of open access goes away with the pandemic. To make the changes broad and permanent, the devil is in the details. In the course of upending an entrenched business model, the question remains: Who will foot the bill?\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/universities-step-up-the-fight-for-open-access-research/",

Despite the \u201cneed\u201d to become more academically competitive in our global economy, this initiative has shown to create the very issues we are facing in 2020. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nThis desire to be the best is the very tinder to the ever-blazing fire in our educational system. We have developed a system where we pit student against student, student against teacher, religion against religion, race against race, and political party against political party. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nPowers that control the educational system have decided that academic success supersedes the human connection. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nInstead of taking the time to discuss why Black Lives Matter, why there are protests, and why things have remained unchanged since the Civil Rights Era, teachers are attached to the curricula. We are taught to re-frame the statement the child makes about the protests to create \u201cdeeper meaning\u201d as we were taught in our undergraduate courses. Instead of allowing them to question injustice we refer them to our history books, \u201cChapter 4, page 78.\u201d This is what we are witnessing.\n\nInstead of allowing experts to guide us through a global health crisis, our nation\u2019s leader took to Twitter to criticize, threaten, and demean the very virus that has crippled our country. Education created that. Instead of following the iterative sciences that would mitigate the spread of the virus, #FireFauci was trending on Twitter. Education created that. Instead of collaborating and demonstrating national cooperation and uniting, #COVIDhoax was trending. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nHuman connection. That is what our educational system has failed to deliver on. A basic understanding that we are in this together. Human connection would have allowed us to understand the need to work together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Human connection would have allowed us to empathize, communicate, support, and march with our brothers and sisters fighting for social justice. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nOur educational system has been so focused on \u201cmaking the grade\u201d and demonstrating the intellectual power that we presume to have over every country. Unfortunately, what benefit does that have over any country if there are injustices occurring within our own country? What benefit does educating the youth have if, during a pandemic, misinformation and conspiracy theories take precedence over facts? This is what you are witnessing.\n\nOur educational system has an ethos problem. We have become accustomed to the factory model of education. This model has been present since the Civil Rights Era and continues to thrive to this day. Despite the \u201cintegration\u201d of schools, we still experience segregation occurring within those \u201cintegrated\u201d schools. Despite the \u201cintegration\u201d of schools, we still experience segregation occurring within our communities. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nThe inability for our nation\u2019s teachers to teach character and truth have molded the minds of ignorance and colorblindness. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that our country has been ravaged by COVID-19 and social injustice within 6 months of 2020. The very people that claim #FireFauci and #COVIDhoax are the very people shouting #AllLivesMatter, #LootingBeginsTheShootingBegins, and #Trump2020. This is a sign of a failed education system. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nThankfully, we are fighting. We are fighting for truth and justice. We are learning the way that we should have learned in our public institutions, through stories, experiences, and connections. We are demanding that the truth no longer be withheld and that we strengthen each other \u2013 it is not a competition. We are in this together. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nThrough the protests we are seeing the strength we have in numbers. Through the protests we are seeing the truth behind the anger, pain, frustration, and sadness that plagues our brothers and sisters of color. Through the protests we are seeing the connections that are required to make change in this country. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nThrough the cancellation of schools, we are seeing teachers realize the importance of human connection. State tests are canceled. The pressure of an evaluation has been lifted. Teachers are no longer focused on the restrictions of the curriculum. Teachers are now focused on supporting the social and emotional needs of their students and communities. They are building the human connection. This is what you are witnessing.\n\nDespite the chaos, pain, death, injustices, lies, hashtags, and racism that we are experiencing, there is hope. Hope that we see human connection can unite us. Hope that our educational system can teach us how to be human. Hope that our educational system can teach us to fight for truth. Hope that our educational system can build us into better people. Hope that our educational system will model to the nation how to tear down walls of injustice and falsifications. Hope that our educational system can bring on change makers. This is what we are witnessing.\n\nOur educational system has failed. But I hope, that through this suffering, we will witness change.",

        "content": "Enrollment at Some For-Profit Colleges Is Way Up. Many Expect that Trend to Continue.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0continues to affect education systems around the world, many have speculated about the medium- and long-term effects it will bring about. Some have worried that this time will allow for-profit colleges to regain momentum\u00a0after facing regulatory pressure\u00a0under the Obama administration. With the first quarter of 2020 in the books, one thing has become clear: enrollment at for-profit colleges is up. In some cases, it\u2019s way up, with year-over-year double-digit percentage increases.\n\nFor-profit college Strayer University\u00a0saw total student enrollment increase\u00a011% compared to Q1 2019. New student enrollment at\u00a0Capella University\u00a0and\u00a0Colorado Technical University (CTU)\u00a0grew by 17% and 16.8%, respectively. Both Strayer and Capella are owned by Strategic Education, Inc. CTU is owned by Perdoceo.\n\nNew Enrollment At Some For-Profit Colleges Is Increasing by More than 10%\n\nThings are also going well for Grand Canyon Education, Inc. The company used to own and operate Grand Canyon University (GCU) as a for-profit institution. Over the past few years,\u00a0it spun off GCU into a non-profit and became a revenue-sharing university program manager. GCU is currently its primary client, and it receives 60% of the revenue generated by the institution. Enrollment at its partner institutions, including GCU,\u00a0is up 5.8%.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent these trends are a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most reports of enrollment increases are for the period between January 1 and March 31 of 2020. While the novel coronavirus certainly had arrived in the U.S. in force by the end of that period, its effects were only just beginning to be fully felt.\n\nThese signals should be taken with a grain of salt for another reason. Most students do not enroll in college during the winter semester. It will remain to be seen whether this trend continues for the summer and fall 2020 semesters. Some for-profits, furthermore, are seeing stark enrollment declines. American InterContinental University (AIU), another holding of Perdoceo, experienced a new enrollment decrease of 14.2%.\n\nStill, many for-profits project that the enrollment surges are just beginning.\n\n\n\nIncreases Will Likely Accelerate in the Coming Months\n\nAmerican Public University, Inc., a company that owns for-profits American Military University (AMU), American Public University (APU), and Hondros College of Nursing (HCN),\u00a0also had a favorable Q1 report. The company expects enrollment at APU and AMU will increase between 8% and 12% for the second quarter of 2020.\n\nAt HCN, things are going even better. \u201cFor the three months ended June 30, 2020 (Spring Term), new student enrollment at HCN increased 56% year-over-year \u2013 a spring-term record for new student enrollment \u2013 and total student enrollment increased 14% year-over-year,\u201d their Q1 report reads.\n\nThis growth has, of course, brought with it increased financial security.\n\nStrategic Education Inc. owns numerous for-profit institutions, namely Strayer University and Capella University, which merged in 2017. The company said they had \u201cfortress financial strength\u201d in their first quarter report (linked above), which was supported by growing enrollment.\n\nAn Opportunity for Growth\n\nThis activity has not occurred passively. In April, the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0reported on\u00a0increased advertising, marketing, and recruitment activity at for-profit colleges, often targeting those furloughed, fired, or stuck at home because of COVID-19.\n\nThe article quotes Steve Gunderson, the president and CEO of the for-profit education lobby group Career Education Colleges and Universities. Gunderson expects mixed improvement in the industry. \u201cOur schools are suffering just like everybody else in the American economy,\u201d he told the\u00a0AP. \u201cThe era of double digit growth in this sector is long gone. And it will not be coming back.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not be true for the sector, it is a reality for some schools in Q1 2020.\n\nStudent advocates worry that, with a growing recession and a decrease in academic oversight, for-profit colleges will have another resurgence, similar to that seen during the Great Recession. Throughout this time, and continuing through to the present,\u00a0students at for-profits defaulted on their loans at significantly higher rates than others, recorded lower graduation rates, and saw worse post-graduation job outcomes.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the\u00a0Hechinger Report, Aaron Ament (president of the National Student Legal Defense Network) and Debbie Cochrane (executive vice president of The Institute for College Access and Success) describe these concerns. They write, \u201ca perfect storm is brewing for a rip-off revival to parallel the predatory for-profit college boom of the 2000s. And the most vulnerable students will inevitably pay the heaviest price.\u201d\n\n\n\nhttps://news.elearninginside.com/enrollment-at-some-for-profit-colleges-is-way-up-many-expect-that-trend-to-continue/",

School trips \n9. Staff meetings (anywhere from 30 to 200 staff members depending on schools size)\n10. Recess \n11. Working with students up-close, especially special needs students \n12. Basically, the ENTIRE school day\n\nAside from schools not having the space or logistics for social distance, good luck getting hundreds & thousands of kids to social distance from one another, or enforce wearing face masks! \n\nI don\u2019t know what a viable and sustainable solution would look like, but being in school is NOT like taking a trip to the grocery store for 2 hours once a week. School is 7 hours a day, 5 days a week. It will be a similar impact as what\u2019s happening in nursing homes across the country, or what was happening on the cruise ships. Mass infection from staff and students who are asymptomatic and symptomatic, giving it to each other in a place they spend a lot of time at, and bringing it into the rest of the community.",

Now, kids on whatever day they come in are potentially exposed, along with anyone they vector to. \n\nAnd, my biggest question of all: who, exactly, is going to be cleaning all of the surfaces twice a day?

        "content": "Universities Step Up the Fight for Open-Access Research\nFIVE YEARS AGO,\u00a0when Jeffrey MacKie-Mason first joined the University of California team that negotiates with academic publishers, he asked a colleague what would happen if he failed to strike a deal. What if, instead, he simply canceled their subscription? \u201cI was told I would be fired the next day,\u201d the UC Berkeley librarian says. Last year, he tested out the theory. The university system had been trying to negotiate a deal to make all of its research open-access\u2014outside of a paywall\u2014with Elsevier, the world\u2019s largest academic publisher. But they were too far apart on what that would cost. So MacKie-Mason\u2019s team\u00a0walked away.\n\nTo his surprise, the army of UC researchers who depended on that subscription were willing to go along with it. They\u2019d lose the ability to read new articles in thousands of Elsevier journals, sure, but there were ways to get by without a subscription. They could email researchers directly for copies. The university would pay for individual articles. And yes, unofficially, some would just probably download from Sci-Hub, the illicit repository where virtually every scientific article can be found. To MacKie-Mason, it was clarifying: The conventional wisdom that had weakened his negotiating hand was thoroughly dispelled.\n\nSince then, progress towards open access has crept along. More deals of the kind UC wants have been struck, especially in Europe. But in the United States, progress has been especially halting. Then, last week,\u00a0MIT officials announced\u00a0that they too had stepped away from the table with Elsevier, saying they couldn\u2019t agree to a deal. And now, University of California officials have announced their intention to make a deal with Springer Nature, the world\u2019s second-largest publisher, to begin publishing the university system\u2019s research as open-access by default. The deal starts in 2021 for a large number of the company\u2019s journals\u2014and puts UC on the path, at least, to do so for all its journals within two years, including its most prestigious ones, like\u00a0Nature.\n\nThe deal is, in many respects, an agreement to keep haggling. But in the open-access research world, it\u2019s a sign of long-awaited changes. Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of the California Digital Library, notes that the deal is poised to be the largest of its kind yet in the United States. Carrie Webster, vice president of open access at Springer Nature, calls it a \u201cblueprint\u201d for other US-based institutions.\n\n\nLots of institutions\u2014community colleges, research universities, city library systems\u2014pay so their members can read paywalled journal research. But only a few actually publish the bulk of it: big universities like MIT and the University of California. (The UC system alone\u00a0contributes about 9 percent\u00a0of published research in the United States.) Increasingly, researchers at those places want their work to be accessible to anybody\u2014for the good of scientific inquiry, to be sure, but also because they increasingly receive grants from funders that require it. (Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt that open-access work is more likely to be seen and cited by other scientists\u2014an important measure of status and influence.) But since journals can\u2019t charge people to access those studies, they charge researchers an extra fee to publish them. Often, the cost runs into the thousands of dollars.\n\nIn recent years, universities have pushed to flip that equation. Under so-called \u201cpay-to-publish\u201d models, like the one the UC system is entering with Springer Nature, the university negotiates the cost of making every piece of research it publishes open access. (That\u2019s opposed to the old \u201cpay-to-read\u201d subscription model.) Universities like UC and MIT are making slightly different demands in how that works. But they share common principles, says Roger Levy, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT who leads the university\u2019s library system committee. \u201cWe should not be paying for content from publishers that aren\u2019t in the business of producing that content,\u201d he says.\n\nFor advocates of open research, these sorts of deals are potentially a good step. \u201cIt gets us closer to an ideal where everything is open-access,\u201d says Michael Eisen, a geneticist at UC Berkeley and cofounder of the Public Library of Science, or PLOS, a major group of open-access journals. (He\u2019s not involved in the UC negotiations.)\n\nBut there are stumbling blocks on that path, Eisen notes, including the status of the most prestigious journals, like\u00a0Nature\u00a0and\u00a0Science\u00a0and\u00a0Cell. Those journals, which have large staffs and reject lots of submissions, are particularly expensive to produce, and publishers have long argued that the economics of making them open-access don\u2019t make sense: The fees to publish would be too high if they couldn\u2019t recoup their costs by charging readers.\n\n\nRecently, that wall of opposition has been cracking. One reason is pressure from agencies that give researchers grants, says Lisa Hinchliffe, a professor at the University of Illinois library. Influential funders including the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are behind a framework, called Plan S, which would ensure that all the research they fund be published outside of paywalls starting in 2021. Then there are signs of trouble in the subscription business model itself: preprints, which go up without paywalls and without peer review,\u00a0have grown in influence. And there are plenty of ways for researchers to circumvent the journal walls, as universities have demonstrated by canceling deals. \u201cThey\u2019ve recognized that gated access to PDFs is only going to work so well,\u201d Hinchliffe says.\n\n\u201cThe publishers have no choice but to reckon with this,\u201d Eisen says. And in recent years, they\u2019ve started to. A number of European countries, like the\u00a0Netherlands\u00a0and\u00a0Germany, have forged open-access agreements with Elsevier, Springer Nature, and others. So have a number of universities in the United States (including\u00a0California State University\u00a0and Carnegie Mellon University with Elsevier). Recently, Springer Nature officials said they would\u00a0sign on to Plan S\u00a0for all its journals, including the flagship,\u00a0Nature,\u00a0and gradually introduce more open-access content over time.\n\nSure sounds like progress. But in the long term, the math isn\u2019t so simple, Hinchliffe says. It goes back to the simple fact that some institutions, but not all, actually publish the bulk of the world\u2019s journal research. Over time, as more major universities switch to pay-to-publish deals, more work will be freed from paywalls. If enough big institutions do that, smaller teaching institutions\u2014the places where scholars just want to read research, not publish it\u2014will be able to cancel their contracts. \u201cBut I assure you they won\u2019t be sending their money to the big research university so they\u2019re able to publish,\u201d Hinchliffe adds. Either the big universities and their research funders will have to pay more, or the publishing industry will have to make less. \u201cEventually, this is going to be a major problem, and I think the major publishers are quite aware of that,\u201d she says.\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason these deals have been easier to broker in Europe so far. In European countries, research funding is more centralized, says Webster of Springer Nature. The company (and others, including Elsevier) have been able to hammer out country-wide deals in which it\u2019s possible to pull together different funding streams\u2014which is necessary, she says, to support open access in expensive journals like\u00a0Nature.\u00a0But in the US, where everything is patchwork, the company has to design ways to separately invoice different funders, institutions, and researchers to cover the costs of publication. Sounds bureaucratic\u2014and it is. It\u2019s also expensive to set up. Webster says the company hopes the bespoke invoicing system it developed will be useful when it works with other US institutions.\n\nOne potential side effect of all that: consolidation. One concern with pay-to-publish models is that big open-access deals could help big publishers firm up their grasp on the industry, and also shut out less wealthy institutions and countries from publishing. Hinchliffe points out that open-access publishing\u00a0is already more consolidated\u00a0than the industry writ large. \u201cScale just has its advantages,\u201d she says.\n\nThose factors contribute to why these current negotiations are so fraught. The deals forged between librarians and publishers will have effects on business models down the road, Eisen notes. Universities that publish a lot want to lock down deals with low publishing fees now, knowing that their access fees will eventually go away. Publishers want to find ways to plug up those drying revenue streams. \u201cMy answer to that is: Nobody says revenue should stay the same,\u201d Eisen says. \u201cThe solution to that isn\u2019t to just reapportion, but to decrease the amount of spending.\u201d Publishers currently make gargantuan profits off of this system. (Both Elsevier and Springer Nature have revenue in the billions and reported operating profits margins of\u00a037 percent\u00a0and\u00a023 percent, respectively\u2014on par with Apple.)\n\nIt\u2019ll likely be a hardscrabble fight to get there. But recently, at least, universities seem to be gaining a stronger hand. And it\u2019s coming with a broader recognition that open-access research is a valuable public good. One need not look further than the Covid-19 crisis, in which prestigious academic journals, long holding up their iron gates, decided (with some urging) to release articles related to the virus for free. (For the record, that\u2019s been WIRED\u2019s approach, too, with stories about the\u00a0health and science of Covid-19.)\n\n\nThat\u2019s enabled doctors in small-town America to read the latest health research without a subscription, notes MIT\u2019s Levy, and for data scientists to scrape massive troves of papers for patterns and insights. \u201cJust imagine if that were the norm, if that were just automatic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great illustration of where we should be for every problem in the world. Not just this one problem.\u201d\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s all temporary\u2014and limited. The promise of open access goes away with the pandemic. To make the changes broad and permanent, the devil is in the details. In the course of upending an entrenched business model, the question remains: Who will foot the bill?\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/universities-step-up-the-fight-for-open-access-research/",

Provided you actually go to college and do well. It can even look better than if you graduated high school and then went to community college and did just as well since you showed you could do the work at an earlier age, and that you were directing your own path.

I returned when I was 18 and tried going to community college. Like you, due to, anxiety, ADHD, as well as culture shock and worse even, weakened communication abilities. I kept withdrawing from school. My third semester was when 9/11 happened. So that multiplied my anxieties ten-fold with the political environment at the time. And I withdrew indefinitely. I left with two F's and maybe 13 W's on my transcript \n\n\n11 years later I requested a GED test, passed it and I returned to CC at 29 years of age, married with three kids, and the goal of becoming a Doctor. I got an academic renewal and repeated another class to wipe out those F's. Older, more mature, and mentally ready for it, I maintained a 4.0 GPA and applied to a Uni. I was rejected. It hurt my confidence and I felt like quitting because of it (anxiety took over again :P ). But after a bit of research I realized that I over thought it, I was just missing a few pre-requisite classes  (I wish those asses would give a rejection reason). I applied again the year after with a 3.9 GPA and three semesters later I was accepted to my first choice university and transferred with a 3.75GPA. That was a 4 year path only in CC. I believe it was my high GPA and powerful personal statement that got me accepted. No recommendation letters at all btw. \n\n\nIt wasn't smooth sailing though. I spent another 3 years living in the next county over (yes, NOT count**r**y) away from family, pursuing BioMedical Engineering. 33 year old me surrounded by all these fresh minded 20 year olds. So making friends was tough, along with the ADHD/anxiety stuff. I was burnt out because it was a lonely path, I struggled controlling my diet, was hit with news of being Pre-Diabetic (The theorized Type III), and my GPA tanked to 2.51. Welp, no more Medical School or anything beyond this bachelors. I was at risk of losing my Minor due to one class so I joined a lab to save it. That lab kept me going, it became my Uni family in a way whenever I was able to get past the anxieties. I hauled ass like no other and impressed my Grad students and Professor. Years of handy man work experience helped me stand out a ton and I got a promotion to Lab Manager as an undergrad. I graduated with a 2.85 GPA, this June of 2019. So I'm a full fledged BME now. I'm just below the cut off for a Masters Degree of 3.0 minimum. But! The professor I impressed, has some pull and can get me an exception! I guess we'll see in the coming months. \n\n\nMoral of all this. It was a 7 year path for me with tons of struggles,  but I stayed the course even when I wanted to *end* it all. My GED was only brought up when I started CC. It was like it didn't exist at all after that point, so all that mattered was my *current* work. When you're mentally ready for it, go for it. Don't rush things. And find your support structure to smoothen the path. The thing acceptance committee's look for, after the basic minimums, is an upward trend. Continuing to show improvement will make overlooking the past easier.",

        "content": "Stop Devaluing the Wisdom of Teachers. Researchers Don't Have a Monopoly on Evidence\nThe drive to use evidence to inform action in education has an essential problem: the academic community's almost religious belief that scientific evidence is the only evidence that has legitimacy. We have arrived at the position where other sources of knowledge are not only devalued, they are rarely acknowledged. Scientifically valid knowledge is widely regarded in the education research community as the only knowledge worth having. A draft paper recently presented at a national conference asserted disapprovingly: \"Teachers do not use evidence,\" referring to the scientific variety.\n\nAs an academic who began as a teacher, I disagree. Such statements are not only arrogant, they are inaccurate. Dominant educational practices drawn from scientific research can be both wrong and damaging\u2014witness the long-held but now discredited conclusion that teaching children reading and mathematics before the age of 8 was a poor use of time.\n\nScientific evidence is not the only source of knowledge nor is it the source of knowledge that always holds high ground in decisionmaking. Two other important kinds of knowledge are what might best be labeled craft knowledge and moral knowledge.\n\nCraft knowledge stems from the understanding gathered over time by practitioners, including through stories, ad hoc observations, and intuition. It is the evidence that usually legitimizes professional judgment in our field, in part because scientific knowledge is not available or cannot be generalized to the thousands of different situations educators face daily. Another strength of craft knowledge is its encapsulation in stories, which are memorable and therefore available to guide action in the moment.\n\nRelated\n\nI have often seen this evidence ridiculed and dismissed by professors and policymakers. And yet what I consider the most valuable evidence I've encountered in my teaching career falls into the craft category. When I taught 1st grade in a poor, rural school in North Carolina in the 1970s, I had a tough little boy named Benjamin for a student. One day he appeared at the door of the classroom crying. \"Someone stole my 3 Musketeers bar,\" he snuffled.\n\nI was on the verge of seeing this issue only through my own eyes and my own understanding of the action: a missing candy bar. But some instinct made me listen instead.\n\n\"My father gave me that 3 Musketeers,\" Benjamin said, trying to sum up the meaning of such a rare treat in his young life. To try to match the weight of Benjamin's emotion, I spoke with the whole class, explaining what the loss of the candy bar really meant to Benjamin. We talked about \"hurt\" and how \"we\" had the ability to help Benjamin be happy again. When we returned to class after lunch and play time, the candy bar was back in Benjamin's cubby.\n\nThat lesson was perhaps the most powerful in my teaching career, and I've shared it many times with my students who are aspiring teachers. If you don't understand a problem from the student's point of view, you are not likely to be able to solve it.\n\nKnowledge from the real world of teaching has high influence. When teachers tell stories like Benjamin's to one another, they listen. What administrators bill as scientific knowledge, on the other hand, is often disappointing.\n\nTake my colleague at that school in North Carolina, Mrs. Wyatt. She was still using phonics to teach reading when I arrived at the school, but then a mandate came down from administrators: \"Use the whole-language approach.\"\n\nSo Mrs. Wyatt taped everything she needed for her phonics lessons on the inside of the double doors that closed off her closet. The doors were open when she taught reading, closed when she had administrative visitors. Eventually, of course, scientific research vindicated Mrs. Wyatt's approach.\n\nWhen such wisdom is raised up, research colleagues react as if their world has been turned upside down and their credibility challenged. They are in the business not of trying to investigate craft knowledge but to replace it.\n\nI have never seen a teacher or principal reject a story as legitimate evidence. That doesn't mean the stories are taken at face value. Counter-narratives often are offered because we should question how best to interpret evidence. But it is not, as routinely suggested, a matter of converting school people to the use of scientific knowledge. It is coming to recognize that scientific evidence does not and should not carry the greatest weight in many school situations.\n\nAnother type of knowledge, moral evidence, is rarely even acknowledged by the education research community. While ethical and equity considerations increasingly shape our profession, they are often conspicuous by their absence from researchers' understanding of decisionmaking in classrooms and schools.\n\nIf educators decide, in relation to disciplinary policy, that it is morally indefensible to keep children after school several days a week, their reasoning seems invisible to researchers. Ethical principles\u00a0as knowledge\u00a0are not allotted a seat at the evidentiary table even when they constitute the first and the ultimate test of a proposed course of action for teachers, principals, students, and parents.\n\nTo move forward, we need to see schooling through the eyes of others. When we do not, reform will fail.\n\nThe dominant question among researchers seems to have become: How do we get school people to use scientific evidence? This is, of course, a very important question. But it is not the right question with which to start.\n\nThe most important question is: How do we begin to acknowledge and use valuable evidence from all sources of knowledge to assist in the improvement of schools?\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2019/10/30/stop-devaluing-the-wisdom-of-teachers-researchers.html",

White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34.

        "content": "U.S. News Releases Its Annual College Rankings. Here\u2019s What\u2019s Wrong With Them.\nU.S. News & World Report just released its 2020 Best Colleges rankings, covering approximately 1400 colleges and universities. For the ninth straight year, Princeton tops the National University list, followed, not unexpectedly, by Harvard in second. Columbia, MIT, and Yale tied for third. Williams College tops the list of National Liberal Arts Colleges, and UCLA is No. 1 among Top Public Schools. All the schools ranked in the top 20 National Universities list in 2020 were in the top 20 in 2019. This rankings inertia stems from both institutional continuity and a largely repetitive methodology.Though U.S. News has revised its methodology over time and continues to tinker with the weights assigned to various measures, fundamental problems remain with the approach, which is based on 15 measures of \u201cacademic quality.\u201d It is too easy for schools to game the system and falsify data. Several of the U.S. News\u2019s measures have become proxies for institutional wealth, and their relevance to academic quality is questionable. Nearly 50% of the weighted indicators are problematic on at least one of these grounds. Here are the most glaring problems:\n\nAlumni giving. The percentage of alumni who gave to their alma maters over the prior two years accounts for 5% of the ranking. U.S. News says that such giving indicates student satisfaction and continuing engagement with a school. But giving is a notoriously easy measure to falsify and bears little relevance to academic excellence. U.S. News dropped the University of Oklahoma and the University of California, Berkeley from the 2019 rankings for submitting false information about alumni donations. And just this month, evidence came to light that the University of Southern California regarded donations from applicants\u2019 families as an admissions factor.\nSmaller class size, at 8%, is another dubious factor. There are two problems here. First, the evidence is equivocal at best that smaller classes produce better student learning yet U.S. News gives it more weight than first-year student retention or the graduation rates of Pell students. Second, would anyone be surprised to learn that colleges play a lot of games to jigger average class size, like capping initial class capacity only to allow more students to enroll later?\nSAT and ACT scores as a measure of student quality are weighted at 7.75%. One would think U.S. News might want to forget about standardized tests as a factor, given numerous revelations about the degree to which they are subject to cheating, a problem made so painfully apparent in the recent college admissions scandal. But that objection misses the bigger point: colleges use the SAT and ACT to exclude applicants so they can score higher on \u201cstudent excellence,\u201d turning the rejection of students into an institutional asset. And they are not above using various tricks \u2013 such as delaying the admission of low-scoring students to the spring semester so their test scores will not be included in the fall semester\u2019s submitted data \u2013 to make entering students\u2019 scores look better than they actually are.\nFaculty salary gets a 7% weighting despite the fact that U.S. News cannot assure that the highest paid faculty are the ones actually teaching undergraduates or that well-paid faculty are more engaged or successful with students than those who are less well-compensated. As a proxy for simple institutional wealth, this one tops the list.\nAcademic reputation is valued at 20%. This is an entirely subjective measure at best and a bogus one at worst. U.S. News claims it measures reputation through a survey it sends to more than 4,000 college presidents, provosts, admission officers. (Thankfully, the survey of high school counselors used in the past as another measure of reputation was dropped this year.) Hundreds of colleges are included in the survey. How does any president or provost even pretend to know the academic quality of so many institutions, let alone make quantitative distinctions among them? No wonder some college presidents have admitted they delegate a staffer in their office to fill out the survey. Or worse, they confess that they downgrade the ratings of peer institutions to make their own college look better by comparison.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/09/09/us-news-releases-its-annual-college-ranking-heres-whats-wrong-with-it/",

Sometimes I answered directly, \u201cMiddle school English.\u201d\n\n## However, my best response to the question was, \"I teach children\".\n\n## The front doors to the middle school opened into the cafeteria where the day officially began for many of the students who ate breakfast and greeted friends.\n\nAndrew, as required, met his teachers just beyond the doors to be searched and observed.  Searched to confiscate non-educational contraband and observed to see if it will be a good day, or not so good.  From his morning greeting, \u201cI hate that fucking bus driver\u201d or \u201cHey, Mrs. Steele\u201d he established the mood - kind of like Jell-O. Everyone was aware that if things heated up Andrew melted down. Except for his colorful vocabulary, this young man embraced a heart of gold and the mind of a toddler encased in the body of a 278-pound teenager.  He responded positively to food and humor but revolted against requests and requirements.  The caring staff surrounding him provided the **grace of diligence** to keep him in school.\n\n## On any given day, after shedding my purse, coat and storing my lunch, I walked through the halls calling out, \u201cWalk on the right.\u201d A high five, and questions about their previous evening welcomed students.\n\nEach had a story to tell - such as Anthony.  He dressed in a red and white striped shirt, tight jeans, carried a backpack and wore black rimmed glasses.  Restraint and concern that students might pick up my chant restricted me from exclaiming, \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo!\u201d Remember the character from the I Spy books? In each book, Waldo was forgetful and lost.  He roamed from page to page and with each turn dropped a personal belonging.  Much the same, Anthony roamed the halls unaware he was watched but hoped all eyes are on him.  Because of his impulsiveness, repeatedly, teachers asked him to put his cell phone in his locker, and he often required redirection to slow down and keep his hands to himself.  For him, constant discipline was not needed but the **grace of encouragement was** required.\n\n## When I returned to my office, a list waited my attention knowing as the day unfolded priorities would demand my attention and the list would grow; it seldom diminished.\n\nOften the list held an inventory of names, students whose misdeeds needed addressing.  Through empathy, consequences, reprimands, and dialogue, I worked beside them developing relationships, plans, goals, choices, and problem-solving skills. When a student walked into the office, inevitably I reminded myself, \u201cHere stands a child searching for the path to adulthood - sometimes just trying to survive.\u201d\n\n## On this day, a secretary announced the first arrival, Tadd.\n\nHe never seemed to have control over his lanky, 12-year-old body.  His reputation preceded him: his fingers stole an iPod, his hands gestured improperly, his arms threw a bolt down the crowded hall, his head repeatedly sported a forbidden hat, and his body performed a victory dance in the middle of class.  If only he had picked up the food he threw in the cafeteria and thoughtfully wrote an apology letter. Whether a mature mind might someday develop to match his age, or his actions would conform to society\u2019s expectations was yet to be seen.  When his parents spoke supportive words in the office, their body language yelled rejection.  Between the lines of his behavior plan, was written the **grace of** **unconditional love.**\n\n## Jenny next walked into the office.\n\nAs she sat down her dyed hair, black clothes, and dark attitude released a gust of sadness that enveloped the room.  A concerned shadow circled her eyes reflecting rebellion with a hint of longing.  The daily point sheet, if it had been picked up at all, returned unsigned by a parent, not because of defiance but knowledge that attempts to get signatures required energy that she didn't possess.  By being tardy to class she prolonged the negative and remained in the fellowship of peers; her refusals to comply masked her failures proclaiming her independence.  Her proclamation of bi-sexuality encouraged acceptance by both girls and boys.  The bulge of her notebook provided evidence of banned notes as a similar bulge in her pocket confirmed the presence of a cell phone; both provided assurances of approval.  Her eyes needed to read the **grace of acceptance** in others\u2019 faces and words.\n\n## In the front office, Amos signed in late.\n\nWhen he didn't come to school his mother wrote excuses the next day.  A professional letter had been sent to the school board and the prosecuting attorney proclaiming him a habitual truant.  When he did attend, he most likely loitered in the halls avoiding the classroom.  Once he wrote on the lockers - maybe to notify everyone of his existence.   A warm and welcoming entrance provided the **grace of hospitality** that brought him back again to roam and search the school halls.\n\n## The saying, \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d attempted to justify actions that in no way warranted justification.\n\nBill understood the pain he caused when he forced a peer into the trash can.  Once bullied, he bullied others. However, the recent death of his friend from cancer still haunted his memories. He made a promise to himself to be kind and live each day positively; he made a promise in honor of his friend.  Tears stained his cheeks as he confessed, admitted, and pleaded his guilt knowing it necessary so he could accept his punishment and the **grace of forgiveness** \u2013 both of which he received.\n\n## Upon opening and reading the emails, I added Johnny\u2019s name to my list.\n\nHis new school requested more information about him.  What could be said about the school\u2019s adopted child?  After eating the school provided lunch, his English teacher provided a toothbrush tucked away in a drawer so he could brush before first period.  Another staff donated some clothes that her son had outgrown and yet another investigated steps to gain foster care licensing.  With his absence, my wash loads decreased but Johnny touched each of us.  In response to the email asking about strategies to support success, I replied, the **grace of generosity.**\n\n## As the bell rang, Louis stopped by the office at the end of the day to retrieve his cell phone.\n\nHis presence obvious when he entered the office. He was loud in the classroom, in the hall, at choir concerts, and on the bus.  Known by teachers, students, parents, substitutes, and bus drivers as the class clown, a disruption, a peeping Tom, and trouble. But despite his disabilities and problems, he never hesitated to smile at all he met. Louis readily helped the disadvantaged. He made me smile even as I handed out consequences and spouted lectures. I granted him the **grace of hope** but understood that his constant enthusiasm and continual endurance provided hope.\n\n## Surrounded by teenagers\u2019 energy, I walked towards the buses wondering how a thousand students exited a building, boarded buses, and disappeared in five minutes.\n\nOutside the buses, students loitered with friends, so strange there was now no hurry to leave the place they had hated and cursed all day. For them must be bestowed the **grace of patience,** so they will learn to accept life for what it has to offer.\n\n## Boys and girls hugged goodbye in a manner that activated memories of watching soldiers leave wives and children as they depart for a tour of duty.\n\nStudents who experienced their \u201cfirst love\u201d (of many to come) learned about future relationships through the gift of the **grace of experience.**\n\n## The day ended with a phone message from an Arizona school principal responding to a request for information about Marcus.\n\nI read the notations quickly realizing his behaviors remained similar since his move to Idaho: argumentative, non-compliant, tardy, disruptive, and violent. Marv\u2019s name remained on my list, at the top, to address tomorrow.\n\n## Each child \u2013 each person \u2013 carries their past which molds who we are and who we will become.\n\nEach one of them and all of us through the sacrifice of others receive grace not because it is deserved, but in fact, because mercy is granted. I daily praise and thank God that we don\u2019t get what is deserved.\n\nTeachers go to college to learn their subjects: math, science, English, history. They are masters of the curriculum. However, teachers teach children. It is often proclaimed,\n\n>\u201cStudents don\u2019t care what you know until the know that you care.\u201d  -[John C. Maxwell](https://www.freespirit.com/files/original/Inspiring-Quotes-Teachers-Jar-preview-1.pdf)\n\nWhen I\u2019ve watched students walk across the stage to receive a diploma, I remember they are not simply graduating from the academics but traveling into a world that requires continual grace.

        "content": "The NCAA chooses money over academics\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to take the \u201cC\u201d out of the NCAA.\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association insists on referring to the participants in its sports as \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d but apparently the governing body has little interest is ensuring that those athletes really are students.\n\nThat\u2019s the upshot of a decision last week by the NCAA\u2019s Board of Directors for Division I schools. The board balked at adopting a recommendation by two NCAA panels that would have given the association authority to police academic scams aimed at keeping athletes eligible.\n\nInstead, the report by the Division I Presidential Forum said the majority of the board thought various half-steps recently adopted by the NCAA were enough to prevent such corruption and the NCAA should not have authority to assess whether courses taken by athletes are genuine courses.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThe concept was to add an overarching bylaw that would capture instances of systemic, willful disregard for academic integrity as it pertains to student-athlete eligibility and/or fair competition. Feedback from the membership on this idea indicated some but not significant support.\u201d\n\nComments trended toward concern that such a provision would be unnecessary and that recent changes in the infractions process will capture systemic academic malfeasance. As such, the (forum\u2019s) Steering Committee decided not to submit the concept at this time.\u201d\n\nAdding the bylaw was recommended by a commission led by former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and by the NCAA\u2019s own academic working group, but the real rulers of college sports \u2014 those who protect the revenue gushers within the top athletic divisions \u2014 were having none of it. In essence, they upheld the disgraceful legal dodge that allowed the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to escape any NCAA sanctions after the university approved more than a decade of phony classes taken by roughly 1,500 athletes.\n\nUNC successfully asserted that only colleges and universities and their accrediting agencies \u2014 not the NCAA \u2014 can decide whether courses meet academic standards. The claim has a surface logic. Obviously, an athletic association has not the resources nor the expertise to assess the academic rigor of real college courses.\n\nBut academic oversight by the NCAA wasn\u2019t what was proposed. What was proposed was that the NCAA should have jurisdiction to assess whether courses that support an athlete\u2019s eligibility are real courses. For instance, it could ask such basic questions as: Did athletes attend classes? Did a professor oversee grading?\n\nIn the UNC case, the answer to both questions was no, but the university escaped sanctions on grounds that the NCAA had no jurisdiction regarding academic quality. The proposed reform aimed to close that loophole by giving the governing body authority to cite obvious and egregious abuses of its requirements that athletes be academically eligible to compete.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s Board of Directors for Division 1 schools is acting here as if it is protecting schools from outside interference. But what the board really did was reject internal scrutiny. The member schools are the NCAA. Two panels supported by the association recommended closing this gap in oversight because it undermines the fairness of competition between NCAA members.\n\nThe board\u2019s decision isn\u2019t about preserving academic independence. It is about protecting the flow of revenue that comes from big-time basketball and football programs. Allowing the NCAA to require that athletes take genuine classes could take more athletes off the court and field. That could cost victories and dollars.\n\nIt is real classes vs. real money. The money, as its always does in major college revenue sports, won. And the integrity of big-time college sports, once again, lost.\n\nhttps://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article233784092.html",

                "content": "GREAT article!\n\nNow, Caplan is wrong even on his own terms.  For example, if he were right, then the incremental value of a college education would decrease with time at a company, since the company would have more direct signals about job performance; but actually the opposite is true.  Employers are demonstrating that they hire for college degrees not because it stands in as a signal for pre-existing attributes, but because they find employees to legitimately do better after college.  Other economists have made this point, but they aren't on a book-promotion tour, so they can't be there to answer every new promo interview that Caplan gives for his book.\n\nBut yes, this is the wrong way to look at things.  Education isn't about getting people ready for their jobs.  It's about a more fulfilling life.\n\nI do wish these authors didn't take such a bleak look on education today.  Their logical leaps aretoo far at several points.  That students complain about school doesn't mean that school is failing them or shouldn't teach them that subject.  Indeed, the authors themselves convincingly argue that, for instance, understanding the history of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, the history of slavery and Jim Crow and segregation, and so on, are important for understanding the world.  That's no less true because a student is bored by history.  That students sometimes struggle, sometimes resent having to learn, and sometimes don't continue in a subject later in life, doesn't mean the school is doing everything wrong or hasn't contributed something of value.  75% of students feeling bored or stressed doesn't mean the school is bad (especially when that stress as often as not comes from childhood trauma at home).  No, every day can't be a performance or an entertainment act, because *learning* happens in the struggle (sometimes... there are bad kinds of struggle, too, of course).\n\n(Similarly, Caplan's argument along these lines is even more ridiculous.  The goal of school has never been to turn anyone into a fan of \"refined\" culture.  That's a cultural preference.  But understanding logic, the universe, and the people in it... well, that's sort of important!)\n\nBut these quibbles aside, well done!",

Media education is not emphasized in most schools, and yet, kids are soaking in media every waking hour. They should be inoculated with information about how advertising and the Internet work from an early age, and keep learning about every new scheme in school. Why? Because kids falling prey to online crimes and deceptions are a waste of taxpayer dollars overall. \n\nThat's the money-way of seeing it. Kids falling prey to scams is also a tragedy that can be prevented with education. \n\nKids are also not taught about money and the economy in most K-12 education. They should be starting to learn the basics of these economic systems starting in 5th grade, and if they're lucky, they take an Economics class in high school. That's not enough. Learning about handling money is as vital as learning to read, but schools don't address the issue very much at all. That's unrealistic. It's also failing kids to leave them so much in the dark. \n\nI also think kids should have a basic law class required in high school. Basic criminal or business law. Introduce the subject. It could inspire some career choices or keep them out of trouble. \n\nWe need reforms, but it's not just to prepare people to be better workers - it should also be to prepare them for life situations.

I was in a shitty abusive relationship and interviewed terribly, because no self esteem or confidence. So I sucked up my pride, and started applying for classroom assistant jobs.

I got an employee number, and could start applying for teaching positions as an internal applicant, not external. Made me more likely to be hired eventually. \n\nBecause I was only part time, the principal wanted me to be able to sub for them during the afternoons if something came up, so she contacted HR and got them to add me to the list. I did that for a while school year, plus September of the next year, then I started subbing full time in October while applying for any jobs posted mid year.

        "content": "5 Big Healthcare Stories, Week of April 30, 2019 - PBMs Exposed, Stocks Bounce Back, and Primary Care Transformation [News]\nHi everyone - here's my picks for the biggest healthcare stories from the past week. As always, please let me know if you have any thoughts or if I missed anything!\n\n  \n\n**1. CMS Inpatient Payment Proposal Released**\n\n**Inpatient payments boosted by 3.7%. Site neutral payment phase-in.**\n\nThis week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (AKA CMS) released its (their?) [**proposed 2020 ruling**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/cms-proposed-inpatient-payment-rule-for-2020-9-things-to-know.html) for the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The IPPS designates Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers for inpatient care. Note that this ruling is just the *proposed* changes to Medicare payments - the final ruling comes out later in the year. Still, the proposed changes give insight into what CMS wants to incentivize for inpatient providers. From Beckers, major highlights from the proposed ruling included the following:\n\n* 3.2% increase for acute care hospitals that report quality data metrics to CMS and use their electronic health records in a [**meaningful way**](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/meaningful-use-and-macra/meaningful-use-and-macra)**;**\n* 3.7% total estimated rate increase for all inpatient providers, when taking into account all new payment policies and uncompensated care;\n* About a 2.6% increase in hospital DSH payments (we've covered this before in our [**January 11 edition - 5th story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/weekly-muse-1-11-2019/) \\- payments for hospitals that have a higher proportion of charity care patients);\n* [**Site neutral payment**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/12-things-to-know-about-site-neutral-payments.html) adjustments for hospital outpatient departments, which could have [**much broader implications on health system consolidation**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/23/716110288/hospitals-chafe-under-a-medicare-rule-that-reduces-payments-to-far-flung-clinics) (FYI, hospitals are NOT pleased about this change) in addition to decreased physician employment by hospitals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rural hospital relief.**\n\nAmong the more interesting changes, CMS seems to be [**extending a lifeline to rural hospitals**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-proposes-wage-index-change-to-help-prop-up-rural-hospitals/553304/), making adjustments to the wage index adjustment in addition to the floor payment that rural hospitals may receive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Healthcare Stocks Bounce Back**\n\n**That didn\u2019t take long.**\n\nEased by strong healthcare earnings reports from the likes of [**Centene**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centenes-membership-growth-fuels-q1-as-ceo-updates-divestiture-plan/553264/), [**UnitedHealth**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-q1-earnings.html), [**Anthem**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-raises-outlook-despite-concerns-over-political-environment-11556125302), [**Encompass**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encompass-health-reports-results-for-first-quarter-2019-and-reiterates-full-year-2019-guidance-300838718.html), and [**others**](http://fundamentalis.com/?p=8901), healthcare stocks came roaring back this week. [**Last week, we covered the dramatic sell-off**](https://www.healthymuse.email/4-22-2019/) of these same stocks. The existential risk stemming from Medicare for All once again resurfaced after the proposed system was admonished as a \"disruptive\" threat to the economy on [**UnitedHealth's Q1 earnings call.** ](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-group-inc-unh-q1-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Buy the dip.**\n\nHealthcare analysts were [**un-perturbed**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-22/goldman-says-health-care-options-showing-little-fear-amid-rout), though, calling it a baseless selloff. Remember that healthcare [**sold in droves**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-stocks-between-2020-and-a-hard-place-11555927381) (paywall - WSJ) before the 2016 election, too. People don't like uncertainty, and healthcare has quite a bit of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare Risks.**\n\nCurrent legislation is not without its effects on public and private healthcare companies. This week, S&P released its [**global healthcare credit ratings report**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/hhs-proposals-possible-congressional-legislation-may-hurt-healthcare-credit-ratings-s-p-says.html), which lists a few risks facing the industry this year. S&P expects policy changes this year in the areas of balance billing and drug pricing rebates, which would affect physician services companies like Envision and MedNax, and pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts, CVS, and UNH, respectively. Funnily enough, S&P has no faith in healthcare reform, at least for now: of all the current legislation and policy proposals out there, the firm lists ACA repeal and Medicare for All as extremely unlikely to happen within the next few years. It makes sense, given the current administration and the Senate makeup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. State of Washington Bill Restricts Nurse's Shifts**\n\n**A Hot Amendment Mess.**\n\nSHB 1155 was intended to be a bill that would help nurses out - mandating that nurses working in hospitals would be given uninterrupted breaks during their shifts. But the bill took a drastic turn when a senator proposed a wild amendment that [**suddenly morphed SHB 1155**](https://mynorthwest.com/1353563/washington-senate-catastrophic-nurse-shifts/) into an entirely different beast - changing nursing shifts from 3, 12 hour shifts a week to 5, 8 hour shifts a week (what's the grammatically correct way to structure that sentence, anyway? Someone PLEASE let me know). Now, hospitals and nurses alike are banding together ([**a rare occurrence, really**](https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2018/07/16/nurses-strikes-nurses-feeling-overworked-across-country/783587002/)) to oppose the bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Backlash from the Bill's passage.**\n\nThe Washington State Hospital Association (AKA the WSHA) had some strong words to say on the bill: *\"If SHB 1155 passes as amended, I am confident that hospitals will not be able to meet the care needs of their communities. Patients will suffer especially in emergencies. This would be terrible for the patients of Washington state.\"* It's interesting to note that the WSHA ***INITIALLY*** opposed the bill, too. Now, the association ironically has the support of nurses across the state of Washington as they try to maintain their 3 day work weeks, an amenity that nurses greatly enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. PBMs Taking Advantage of Medicaid?**\n\n**Drug Pricing Contagion.**\n\nA [**new report from 46 Brooklyn**](https://www.46brooklyn.com/research/2019/4/21/new-pricing-data-reveals-where-pbms-and-pharmacies-make-their-money) analyzed various generic specialty drugs covered by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) under Ohio's managed Medicaid program (i.e., Ohio essentially lets insurance companies run Medicaid for them). After matching state drug utilization data against PBM drug cost data, the 46 Brooklyn report found that PBMs appeared to be marking up generic specialty drugs (a practice known as [**spread pricing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-drug-spread-pricing/)) by a total of almost $11 million in one quarter alone by controlling the specialty pharmacy market. As a result, Ohio's Medicaid program probably way overpaid for these drugs, and cost the state's taxpayers big bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Broader ramifications.**\n\nIf it's happening in the Ohio managed Medicaid program, it's probably happening elsewhere, too. The report concludes by stating SOME transparency in healthcare (specifically, drug pricing) is not enough. 46 Brooklyn called for a 100% transparent system to spur competition and bring to light the secretive pricing practices that PBMs seem to engage in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The PBM Defense.**\n\nAs [**Axios reported**](https://www.axios.com/specialty-pharmacies-drug-prices-medicaid-9f422bdb-4cb7-479b-a7da-a6ea02abb1e6.html), the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (AKA pro-PBMs) gave a [**strong response**](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5976111-PCMA-Statement-on-46brooklyn-Report.html) to the analysis. The PCMA claimed that the data was 'cherry-picked' questioned the reliability of its data sources, and stated that the analysis did not take into account rebates, discounts, or overall plan outcomes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. HHS Proposes 'Transformative' Primary Care Models**\n\n**A new primary care path forward.**\n\nThis week, HHS and CMS [**announced new initiatives**](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-news-hhs-deliver-value-based-transformation-primary-care) designed primarily to lower administrative costs and consequently allow physicians more time with patients. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tell me about these initiatives.**\n\nThe proposal will have five payment models under 2 different systems - Primary Care First, and Direct Contracting. Primary Care First (PCF) seems to be more or less a value-based (i.e., patient outcome-driven) [**capitation**](https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/about-internal-medicine/career-paths/residency-career-counseling/guidance/understanding-capitation) type model - where a physician will receive monthly lump payments adjusted for his or her patient base's acuity levels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about the Direct Contracting model?**\n\nWhile the PCF models are more focused on individualized primary care practices, Direct Contracting (DC) models will be focused more-so on patient populations. DC models will partner with ACOs, managed care plans, and other population health managers to give these plan providers various \"risk\" options. Based on the level of \"risk\" they choose, the DC model will reimburse them fixed monthly payments of varying amounts. For instance, if an insurer chose a \"riskier\" payment option, the insurer would receive a higher fixed payment up front from Medicare, but they would also be on the hook if catastrophic disease rampaged their population/covered lives. It all depends on how these participants manage financial risk versus receiving fixed, predictable revenue streams.\n\nThese new models were introduced in an attempt to reduce overall healthcare costs and to see whether these types of models would produce better outcomes for patients. We'll see!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What else?**\n\nIn other primary care news, Humana announced the launch of its new virtual care model, partnering with Doctor on Demand to form its On Hand health plan.

        "content": "This is my view on how we need to address our chronic disease challenges at scale. Let's discuss!! [Discussion]\n# Where are we now?\n\nIf 2020 has taught us anything, it\u2019s the value of good health (both physical and psychological), and the fragility of it.\n\nWe made huge progress in many areas of medicine over the last century. We can now expect to live 81 years in the UK for example, that\u2019s 24 years longer than in 1920 (life expectancy of 57).\n\nBut, with any massive global change and \u2018progression\u2019, there are pros and cons. We live life at a faster pace than ever before, we consume a completely different diet due to mass production, convenience and taste, we sit for longer periods, we\u2019re less active, and many local communities are fizzling out. As a result, environment and lifestyle created conditions are increasing at a rate we haven\u2019t seen before \u2014 type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, high blood pressure, cancers, and psychological conditions like depression and anxiety, all on the rise.\n\nI\u2019ve written this article to draw out the path we\u2019re currently on, the solutions available to us, and my view on how to address our chronic disease challenges at scale.\n\n# An Unsustainable Approach to Medicine\n\nThe world is gradually acknowledging that the way we\u2019ve done medicine for the last century, isn\u2019t compatible with managing health in the modern world. Doctors are still taught to treat diseases which have already occurred. But in reality, most modern illnesses are the result of an accumulation of small, automatic behaviours over a series of months, years, and decades.\n\nTreating chronic (long term) disease after the fact is unsustainable. The annual cost of treating someone with type 2 diabetes is around [\u00a35000 per year](https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/cost-diabetes), that\u2019s nearly 2.5 times as much as treating someone without the condition. And it\u2019s anticipated that if we continue on the same track as we are, [1 in 3 Americans will have type 2 diabetes by 2050](https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2010/r101022.html). You don\u2019t need an economist to explain that even the richest countries in the world will be crippled by the cost of these treatments at that scale.\n\nOn top of the direct costs of treating chronic diseases. We have to consider the secondary effects. They have a huge impact on quality of life, productivity and mental wellbeing, often for decades of someone\u2019s life. In the UK, we can expect to live with disease [from 61 years old](https://gracegimson.medium.com/the-stark-truth-about-british-health-391970dffde1), on average, however more and more people are developing long term conditions, like type 2 diabetes, in their 30s and 40s.\n\n# Enough Doom and Gloom\u2026..What\u2019s the solution?\n\nThrough addressing lifestyle behaviours, we can significantly change our health outcomes. By improving just a handful of our health behaviours while under 50 (like physical activity, vegetable consumption, alcohol intake) we can [increase our disease free lifespan by up to 20 years](http://www.bandolier.org.uk/booth/hliving/Lifedeath.html).\n\n\u2018By improving just a handful of our health behaviours while under 50, we can increase our disease free lifespan by up to 20 years\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s a challenge to get a 20, 30 or even 40 year old to recognise the importance of making changes early, before the onset of disease. And the process itself is hard while we live in a high paced, stress inducing environment. And of course, ability to change is affected by so many factors, including deprivation.\n\nAn effective solution calls for a multi pronged approach\u2026.\n\n## Better awareness and education:\n\n* Communities and individuals need to be made aware of the facts around what causes chronic diseases. Obesity is the main cause for type 2 diabetes, heart conditions, and 30% cancers, and now we know it significantly increases risk of death from Covid 19 infection too. This information should come through public health, GPs, local councils at a minimum.\n* Schools and colleges need to provide clear education about nutrition and physical activity throughout school years.\n* Facts on their own are not enough. Personalised information on what to change and how to follow through is just as important.\n\n## Government levers:\n\n* Governments will need to raise taxes on the least healthy foods, or in some cases prevent production, to reduce consumption of some foods, in the same way smoking has been addressed. But taxing food and drink is more complex than smoking. We need food to survive, and often people\u2019s options are limited by cost, availability, cooking facilities.\n* Benefits systems need to support those in the most deprived communities, with access to healthy foods and facilities to prepare fresh meals.\n* Exercise should be encouraged through more government paid for exercise classes, more GP exercise referrals, better local sport facilities, safe cycle paths.\n* The introduction of [NHS health coaches](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/health-coaching-implementation-and-quality-summary-guide.pdf) (to support patients with lifestyle behaviour change) this year is a really interesting interesting step in the right direction.\n\n## Medicine:\n\nThere are numerous medical approaches to treating or preventing chronic diseases and obesity (a precursor to many of these diseases). Here are a few which will grow significantly over the coming decade:\n\n* **Genetic testing** for personalised lifestyle recommendations or treatments. We\u2019re [learning more about the impact of genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471589/) on weight, and chronic disease development. The likes of 23andme will develop more accessible test kits for individuals to understand how their genes impact their outcomes, and what they can do about it.\n* Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are in a race to develop **new pills and drug concoctions** for obesity prevention and disease treatment. For example, [PureTech Health have been approved by the FDA for their weight loss capsule](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/04/15/puretech-health-affiliated-weight-loss-drug-gets.html) which fills up your stomach before meals.\n* **Bariatric and gastric surgery** rates are on the up, but with [costs of surgery ranging from \u00a35000-\u00a315000](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/weight-loss-surgery/), and risks of serious side effects during or after the procedure, it\u2019s no silver bullet.\n* **Behaviour change for prevention**. Preferable to *treating* disease or obesity, is preventing it. Costs are lower, and results can be very effective. [People diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can even reverse that diagnosis and go into remission](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/reversing-diabetes.html) through behaviour change alone.\n\n## Health Technology:\n\n* Digital technologies can enable solutions (particularly behaviour change solutions) to scale rapidly. They offer personalisation, tracking, and are \u2018always on\u2019. Just last month, the UK NICE published new formal guidance, [recommending the healthcare commissioning of digital and mobile approaches for behaviour change](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng183/chapter/Recommendations#diet-and-physical-activity), based on a mounting base of evidence.\n* The big tech giants (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon) are all taking steps into the health arena with various evolving focuses, from wearables, to at-home care tools, to tracking apps, to entirely new healthcare services, like [Amazon Care](https://amazon.care/).\n\n# The Future\n\nThe current approach, to treat patients after diseases have set in, is going to become completely unsustainable. Successful prevention of chronic disease requires behaviour change, and behaviour change is hard.\n\nWe need to make lifestyle behaviour change achievable. We need to make it accessible to millions, if not billions, and we need to act fast.\n\nWithin 10 years time, most of us will be supported by a highly intelligent and personalised digital health coach in our pockets, or on our wrists. Emphasis on the word **\u2018coach\u2019**. The digital coaches of the future will be informed by an individual\u2019s genomics, lifestyle, and millions of data points. To make lifestyle changes possible, each individual will be provided with the right information, nudges and rewards, at the right times. And crucially, they will coach how to make *gradual, consistent and lasting changes*, as opposed to the traditional boom and bust diet approach. We all know that we should eat better and exercise more, but an effective coach helps us to understand exactly which steps to take each day, why to take them, and motivates us to follow through. Without the \u2018coach\u2019 element, we\u2019re on our own again.\n\n**We launched Holly Health to meet this need**. Holly Health provides an effective, accessible and scalable digital coach for health behaviour changes (both physical and psychological). We will be ready to operate in clinical environments in 2021.",

The ruling will ease the ways that personal health data can be shared across electronic health record platforms like Epic and Cerner. \n\n* Because the rule standardizes data sharing methods AND mandates that consumers will have access to their own health records online, the final interoperability ruling is expected to have huge effects on the health data industry. \n\n**Think about it like this**: every provider has its own health records system. This system acts similar to a '[**walled garden**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Closed_platform)' for providers, which keeps patients coming back to them. With the final HHS interoperability ruling, these walls are coming down. In my mind, that makes it much easier for the patient to switch between providers.\n\n* **Things to consider**: This news ALSO means that new entrants, a la, Amazon/Apple/Google, will have an easier time competing with traditional players like Epic and Cerner. And there's also that whole patient data privacy thing, too. If sharing personal health data gets easier, that means less privacy over your health data. Is this ruling too big of an administrative burden on providers?

As always, a ton of interesting healthcare stuff this week. I'm keeping my eye on Walmart's continued push into healthcare. If they're successful, it could have major implications for primary care, especially in more rural areas.\n\nLet me know if you guys caught anything big that I missed! I should note: I write these on Monday for the newsletter, so some information (like caucus results, etc). gets *slightly* outdated. *(If you want to read past editions or learn more about the newsletter,* [*you can find that here*](https://thehealthymuse.com/)*.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bigger Stuff.\n\n**Walmart's Second Primary Care Clinic Opens.**\n\n* Walmart Health is [**continuing its assault**](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/04/walmart-just-dragged-primary-care-into-the-healthc.aspx) on traditional primary care.

One of those board members was Mark Bertolini - who was the former CEO of Aetna. If you recall, CVS acquired Aetna and has been integrating its operations over the past year. Mr. Bertolini was on the board to assist with that integration, which CVS says is now fully complete.\n\nThe only problem is\u2026Mr. Bertolini disagrees. He [**claims**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-aetna-ceo-mark-bertolini-says-he-is-being-pushed-off-cvs-board-11580745512) (paywall - WSJ) he was forced off CVS' board. \n\n* **From the article:** \u201cI was willing to continue to serve on the board of directors in support of the most transformative effort in health care for our nation. However, the board thought otherwise.\u201d\n\nEither way, we'll see how the integration is going - CVS reports earnings on Wednesday, February 12.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Everything new on the Coronavirus.** \n\n* As of this writing, the number of infected is \\~41k and reported deaths at \\~1k.

What's so special about the Medicines Company? They're in the process of developing a cholesterol drug with tech called [**RNA interference**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/RNA_interference). \n\n* Since the heart disease market is huge (cholesterol alone is expected to reach a $17.7 billion market by 2024), Novartis probably wants to get ahead of the new tech and combine the cholesterol drug with its own heart failure drug, Entresto. \n* Keep in mind that this deal comes on the heels of a [**landmark heart disease study**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/11/16/embargoed-drugs-are-effective-invasive-procedures-patients-with-stable-heart-disease-major-trial-finds/) released last week, which indicated that invasive surgery (AKA stents) is no more effective than drugs at treating heart disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Patient Privacy backlash.**\n\n**Patient privacy** has been top of mind over the past couple of weeks after the Google-Ascension partnership dropped last week ([**read about that here**](https://thehealthymuse.com/google-and-ascension-partnership-controversy/)).

If not\u2026less $$$.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Warren backs off on Medicare for All.**\n\n* Elizabeth Warren [**backtracked**](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/m4a-transition) a bit on her Medicare for All plan.

Bipartisan deals are probably a bit hard to come by right now.\n\n### \n\n### Congress once again delays DSH cuts.\n\n* As a part of the broader budget deal, the House [**pushed back**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/house-pushes-back-medicaid-dsh-cuts.html?oly_enc_id=1916A0565789F4V) Medicaid DSH cuts (i.e., the program that pays back hospitals who see a lot of charity care patients) until December. Remember that the ACA initially wanted to phase out these payments by 2025. \n* In its final rule this year, CMS already laid out a [**roadmap**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals-health-systems/cms-finalizes-rule-dsh-cuts-worth-up-to-8b-annually-through-2025) to reduce DSH payments as compelled by the ACA, but Congress keeps intervening and delaying the cuts. I would look for potential reform to the disproportionate share hospital program in 2020. \n* Right now, DSH is paying out around $18.1 billion to over 3,000 hospitals.\n\n### \n\n### Hospitals sue HHS over alleged underpayments.\n\n* Over 600 hospitals just [**sued**](http://bit.ly/35kWTbY) HHS over an a few billion dollars in underpayments.\n* They claim that HHS illegally reduced inpatient hospital reimbursements starting in 2017 and continuing into 2018 and 2019\n\n### \n\n### FDA nominee testifies.\n\n* Stephen Hahn, the current FDA nominee, [**testified**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-nominee-hahn-expected-to-face-questions-on-vaping-policy-11574254800) (WSJ paywall) in front of a Senate panel this week. \n* The panel focused in on whether he'd be willing to combat vaping as well as fight drug prices.

For the last two years I have worked at a company where I\u2019ve been In the front office. \n\nMy title is only office specialist but essentially I\u2019ve been managing it on my own since I only have one coworker and he doesn\u2019t doesnt retain information and doesn\u2019t do things correctly so i end up having to just do it as my boss is aware of. And I do a range of things from HR, transferring calls, paying the bills for my job, sending invoices, creating invoices, inputting in customer contracts. Our daily deposit, balancing our monthly income/billing . Scheduling technician days. This is my first big girl job since i graduated high school three years ago. So I feel like all these would transfer over to the healthcare field well.   \n\nPlus I just enrolled in school in August and am trying to finish my medical office technology associates. So far I\u2019ve taken some business classes and Microsoft and excel and medical terminology. I should finish in about a year and a half.   The reason I\u2019m saying all this is because I don\u2019t have any direct experience in the administrative healthcare field but it\u2019s also been something I\u2019ve wanted to do(not nursing I can\u2019t stand blood) . I\u2019ve applied to a few different jobs but haven\u2019t gotten a call back and I\u2019ve tried to network on LinkedIn not asking for jobs but just connecting with people in the healthcare field or people who had recently got a job in that to get their opinions and advice on getting my foot in the door. I\u2019ve been working on it for the past 3 weeks and   \n\nI only got one response from another linked in member who was EXTREMELY sweet and nice. She offered to refer me to people and said she knew were looking for people at physician offices and things. But unfortunately for me  i realized she lives in Pennsylvania . So obviously that\u2019s a dead end .  I live in the Memphis/TN, Southaven/MS area and am just wanting advice from experienced people On how to market myself, or even know what jobs I may have a chance at. Thank you!",

Let me know if you prefer this shorter-form format better!\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug makes a comeback**\n\n* It seemed like Biogen's Alzheimer's drug, - a therapy called aducanumab - was dead after its March clinical trial results came back with gloomy results. All trials were stopped immediately, and Biogen's stock got destroyed that day. For good reason, too - the drug was expected to be a blockbuster.\n* Fast forward seven months later. In a reversal for the ages, Biogen [**announced last Tuesday**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-22/how-biogen-salvaged-its-alzheimer-s-drug-after-a-costly-failure) that after re-analyzing the trial, there was actually data to prove that larger doses of the treatment COULD actually be effective in mitigating Alzheimer's. The stock surged 26% on the news.\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**Google makes a bid for Fitbit, signalling its desire to enter the wearables market**\n\n* [**Reuters reported**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitbit-m-a-alphabet-exclusive/exclusive-google-owner-alphabet-in-bid-to-buy-fitbit-sources-idUSKBN1X71NY) that Google is making a bid to buy out Fitbit. It looks like the tech giant is trying to get into the wearables space, which has pretty much been dominated by the Apple Watch in recent years.  \n* Even though wearables and their data haven't really made any push into providing meaningful clinical data for providers, Google's competitive bid for Fitbit just goes to show that they think there's a big potential market here. As data tracking gets better and wearables tech improves, I wouldn't be surprised to see significant progress with wearables and the intersection of wellness and preventive care.\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**Amazon Acquires Health Navigator**\n\n* In its first healthcare-related purchase since PillPack a year ago, Amazon [**acquired**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/amazon-acquires-digital-health-start-up-health-navigator.html) a company called Health Navigator this week. The company more or less tells employees where they should go seek care based on the symptoms that they have (i.e., do you have a nail in your foot? You should probably go to the ER!) among having other virtual care functions.\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPS Unveils Medical Drone Delivery Platform** \n\n* UPS has been pretttttty busy this month. Earlier in October, UPS [**received approval**](https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=24277) to operate drones commercially - the first approval ever in the U.S. Now, in this week's futuristic story, UPS [**announced its plans**](https://www.axios.com/ups-commercial-drone-fleet-faa-fcd62eb5-1c93-4507-a787-fe8c79a6ae0c.html) to deliver supplies and other things via \\~DRONE\\~. Yeah, that means giant 4-rotor mechanisms flying in the sky to your local community hospital. Keep your curtains closed.\n* Okay, not quite to that level yet - but UPS does have major partnerships lined up with big-time players, including CVS, Kaiser Permanente, AmerisourceBergen, and others. The drones will carry things like prescriptions, medical supplies and instruments, and pharmaceuticals to hospitals and customers' homes. \n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare Policy Update.**\n\n* **Vaping Tax Bill**: The House Ways and Means Committee is considering a [**vaping tax bill**](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/466749-house-panel-to-consider-vaping-tax-bill-this-week) this week. The bill would tax vaping products at the same level as tobacco products. \n* **Flavored Vaping Ban**: Not to be outdone, the FDA is actually about to [**ban flavored e-cigs**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/467469-fda-working-as-quickly-as-possible-on-e-cigarette-flavor-ban) for good. This ban would exclude mint and menthol flavors (thank goodness) and is coming on the heels of over 1,600 vaping related mysterio-illnesses.\n* **FTC Scrutinizes Hospital Mergers**: This week, the Federal Trade Commission phoned a few hospital friends along with major insurance companies to [**request data on recent mergers and acquisitions**](https://www.axios.com/ftc-hospital-merger-data-ab33ed8d-646b-4db4-8cdb-6f2b85195c0c.html). The agency is really trying to hone in on certain states with certificates of public advantages (COPA) - namely, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia - states with large rural areas. In particular, the FTC wants to research whether COPAs are good for the public or not.\n* **Healthcare Lobbying Update**:  \n   * **PhRMA** spent $6.2 million as drug pricing legislation bounces around Congress to no avail (currently)\n   * Amgen: $3 million\n   * Bayer: $2 million\n   * AbbVie: $1.8 million\n   * Pfizer: $1.6 million\n   * Gilead Sciences: $1.5 million\n   * Meanwhile, don't forget about the [**surprise billing lobbying blitz**](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/10/surprise-medical-bills-legislation-drives-spike-in-q3-lobbying-spending/) happening at the other end of the healthcare world, totaling $4.1 million in lobbying spending in the third quarter alone.\n* **Carcinogenic breasts**: The FDA might require breast implant manufacturers to [**post cancer warnings**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-agencys-continued-efforts-protect-womens-health-and-enhance-safety-information-available) on its labels.\n* **Rural ACOs get a lift**: Senators are considering [**boosting payments**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/senators-propose-bill-boost-payments-rural-acos) to rural ACOs \n* **ACA Replacement Republican Healthcare Plan?** Here's a [**quick writeup**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/republicans-have-an-aca-replacement-plan-5-notes.html) on what any possible ACA replacement might look like from the Republican party. Main takeaway: give more regulatory power to the states, save pre-existing conditions, and give Medicaid block grants. [**Read the full report here**](https://rsc-johnson.house.gov/sites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/RSC%20Health%20Care%20Plan%20-%20A%20Framework%20for%20Personalized%2C%20Affordable%20Care.pdf).\n* **Big win for payors**: The U.S. was just ordered to [**cough up**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/us-ordered-to-cough-up-159b-in-subsidies-to-kaiser-oscar-other-payers/565845/) $1.59B in subsidies to Kaiser, Oscar, and other payors\n* **AI and Fraud Detection**: And finally, the CMS is looking to use artificial intelligence to [**help with fraud**](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/10/cms-wants-to-use-artifical-intelligence-to-sniff-out-home-health-fraud) \\- especially in home health, where fraud can be rampant.\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other Interesting/Notable Healthcare Stories:**\n\n  \n\n**Biz Hits**\n\n* **Opioids Update**: Last week, we touched on the \\~$50 billion opioid settlement. [**Reuters reported this week**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioids-litigation/drug-companies-avert-landmark-opioids-trial-as-talks-on-48-billion-settlement-set-to-resume-idUSKBN1X0156) that talks have resumed between 4 states and the drug firms. The two sides are targeting a $48 billion settlement, but not all states are fans of the agreement since it [**might not get split up fairly**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioid-lawsuits/several-states-wary-of-48-billion-opioid-settlement-proposal-idUSKBN1X315P)\n* **Hospital Profitability**: Health system operating margins were up in 2018, but are still below the highs seen in 2015. Read the interesting whitepaper from Navigant [**here**](https://www.navigant.com/-/media/www/site/insights/healthcare/2019/navigant-hsfa-whitepaper.pdf). A notable insight: smaller health systems were more profitable than larger health systems.\n* **CVS CEO Interview**: Healthcare Dive had a [**nice chat**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/5-insights-from-a-chat-with-larry-merlo-ceo-of-cvs-health/565478/) with CVS CEO Larry Merlo, which gave some insights into how the business views Amazon, its integration with Aetna, and more.\n* **Teladoc Expands Services**: Looks like Teladoc is trying to differentiate itself from other telemedicine ventures. This week, Teladoc launched a service called [**Teladoc Medical Experts**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/25/1935684/0/en/Teladoc-Health-Launches-Teladoc-Medical-Experts-for-Complex-Physical-and-Mental-Health-Conditions.html). The service is meant to cover a broader range of medical conditions and diagnoses than the typical virtual care operator currently provides. \n* **Livongo Partners with Telehealth**: Speaking of telehealth, Livongo is continuing its partnership spree by [**teaming up**](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/28/1936341/0/en/Livongo-Integrates-Access-to-Telehealth-in-Support-of-People-Living-with-Chronic-Conditions.html) with MDLIVE and Doctor on Demand, giving their members access to behavioral health and then eventually diabetes and hypertension offerings.\n***\n&#x200B;\n\n**State Hits**\n\n* From Politico - why North Carolina might be the [**most innovative state**](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2019/10/24/north-carolina-health-care-001291) on healthcare in America.\n* **The New York Health Act** \\- which would establish single payer in New York - is drawing crowds.

Apologies for missing last week. Here's a recap of what you might have missed last week in the healthcare world:\n\n* Providers scored a big win when a federal judge scrapped [**CMS' Site-Neutral payment policy**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hospitals-score-victory-as-judge-tosses-cms-site-neutral-rule/563170/). \n* The judge ruled that HHS doesn't have the appropriate level of authority to enforce payment policy on hospitals. This ruling was reminiscent of the mandatory television drug ad price disclosure ruling that was [**also shot down in court**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/judge-axes-price-disclosure-rule-drug-ads) earlier this year on a similar principle.\n* Nancy Pelosi [**released her plan to bring down drug prices**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pelosi-wants-government-to-negotiate-prices-of-costliest-drugs-11568898000) (paywall - WSJ) - namely, the costliest 25 or so drugs would be subject to direct pricing negotiations with the federal government.\n* These negotiations would be tied to an international pricing index, and drug-makers would be penalized for not participating. (If you're so inclined, here's the [**bill in its glorious entirety**](https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Bills-116hr3hi_intro%2009.19.2019_Lower%20Drug%20Costs%20Now.pdf)).\n* The Pharmacy Benefit Management industry continues to get challenged by new players and potential [**disruptions**](https://www.managedhealthcareconnect.com/article/general-session-pbm-industry-evolving-or-disrupting). The latest contender, Capsule (similar to PillPack), [**just raised $200 million**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/pharmacy-startup-capsule-raises-200-million-to-grow-beyond-nyc) to take on industry titans like PillPack, CVS, and others.\n* Walmart Health continues its surge forward. The retail giant just [**partnered with Amedisys**](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/09/walmart-health-amedisys-partner-to-expand-home-health-access-nationwide/), one of the largest (and still growing) home health and hospice players, to expand access to home health across the nation. Sam's Club is also joining the party by offering a [**pilot program**](https://apnews.com/87286f917cdc440ca5dfc2dfdf0893aa) to its members to offer discounts on certain routine care items (shout out to the Groupon story from a few weeks ago).\n* Not to be outdone by the old guard Walmart, Google Health just [**completed its somewhat controversial acquisition**](https://www.blog.google/technology/health/deepmind-health-joins-google-health/) of AI-focused DeepMind, which is expected to further enhance its efforts to [**push into healthcare**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/artificial-intelligence/google-health-takes-over-deepmind-4-things-to-know.html) \\- including data security, cloud storage, and other important characteristics.\n* Humana's CEO David Jones passed away this week. The WSJ highlights his life and Humana's origins in a [**memoir**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-a-jones-co-founded-humana-creating-a-health-care-giant-11568909260).\n* Washington Medicine, MultiCare, and LifePoint Health just [**created a huge clinically integrated network**](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/uw-medicine-multicare-lifepoint-health-create-network) covering 14 hospitals, 6,500 providers, and 600 outpatient sites of care in the Pacific Northwest. \n\nNow - on to this week's stories!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. Amazon Pilots Primary Care Platform for Employees\n\n**Another day, another healthcare launch.**\n\n* This week, Amazon launched [**Amazon Care**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/amazon-launches-employee-health-clinic-amazon-care.html) for its employees. Basically, Amazon is trying to cut down on healthcare costs (like everyone else), so the company is [**offering**](https://amazon.care/) a slew of primary care options - including virtual care and in-home nurse visits. The initiative is piloting in the Seattle area for Amazon's employees. *Don't tell* [***Whole Foods***](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/09/13/business/ap-us-amazon-whole-foods-health-care.html) *workers about it, though.*\n\n**In other Amazon news\u2026more health wearables tech.**\n\n* Amazon wants to take on the 'ole AirPods. This week, the e-commerce giant unveiled its [**wireless Alexa earbuds**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/amazon-plans-alexa-earbuds-with-fitness-tracking-echo-with-subwoofer.html) containing fitness tracking, among other planned gadgets recently announced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Employer-Sponsored health insurance premiums top $20K for the first time\n\n**A new car a year\u2026or health insurance?**\n\n* A recent [**Kaiser survey**](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2019-employer-health-benefits-survey/) showed that employer-sponsored health insurance premiums [**rose**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/worker-health-insurance-costs-surpass-wage-growth-survey-finds/563756/) to an average of $20,576 for family coverage. It's a bit alarming - the annual premium growth rate has been above both inflation *and* wage growth for quite a while. Employees are increasingly paying a higher out-of-pocket share for healthcare costs. We all know how hard it is to spot a bubble but\u2026are we in a bubble?\n\nAs we get closer to any potential breaking point (hopefully none), you're going to start seeing employers take more extreme measures to lower their costs. \n\n* Such cost cutting measures could include direct contracting with primary care physicians, or self-funding insurance plans with insurance coverage for \"extreme\" emergency spending. Others might opt to cut their labor force.\n\nEmployers with larger, concentrated labor market share in local markets will have better leverage to push providers and payors alike for increased transparency and more favorable contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. 23andMe's predictable push into drug development\n\n23andMe is moving quickly into the field of drug development, and its first push is a predictable and seemingly natural step for the company - [**clinical trial recruitment**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/26/23andme-clinical-trial-recruitment/). \n\n**23andEveryoneElse.**\n\n* Based on all of the information us common folk paid to hand right on over to the DNA testing company, 23andMe is partnering with TrialSpark, a more tech-savvy version of a contract research organization, to recommend customers for clinical trials based on those customers' DNA, demographic or other characteristics.\n\nThese DNA testing firms are now sitting on a ton of probably-valuable genetic testing data, and they're not going to sit idly with that (potentially sensitive) information. \n\n* The more specialized data matching processes might actually be really helpful to drug makers and research teams as they work on developing drugs for tricky diseases. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remote Access.**\n\nHere's the revolutionary part. As Stat notes in its story, 23andMe and TrialSpark might actually solve what has traditionally been a huge barrier for clinical trials - geography. Instead of needing all of the patients for a trial in one location, the partnership is trying to digitize clinical trials. That might mean that patients could walk into their local doctor's office to report data rather than flying to another facility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Air Ambulance operator Air Methods is planning to cut insurance out and contract directly with employers\n\n**Fed up.**\n\n* After its inability to reach contracted agreements with large payors like Cigna, United, and Aetna, Air Methods - an air ambulance operator (think helicopter care flights) - is cutting the insurance middleman out by attempting to [**contract directly**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/air-methods-in-talks-to-contract-directly-with-large-employers/563604/) with employers.\n\nHelicopter care flights are prohibitively expensive as-is, and even more so if that patient is out of network. By contracting directly with employers like Walmart and Tyson Foods, Air Methods might start the trend of cutting out payors and working directly with employers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5. Policy Corner, week of September 30 2019\n\nSince you guys are probably getting enough of the whole impeachment thing in the 5-second revolving door news cycle, let's take a breath of fresh air into the world of healthcare policy:\n\n* Mitch McConnell is not a fan of Pelosi's drug pricing proposal. He's already planning to [**block the measure**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/trump-whipsaws-gop-on-drug-pricing-1763102), citing socialist pricing controls. Pelosi's plan [**might have missed the mark**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2019/09/26/the-missed-opportunities-in-nancy-pelosis-prescription-drug-reform-bill/#3d0e3c3d1c70) on other drug pricing inputs, anyway.\n* Here's the latest on [**surprise billing legislation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/Here's%20the%20latest%20on%20surprise%20billing%20legislation,%20too.), too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\n**Biz Hits**\n\n* Peloton set its [**IPO price at $29**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/peloton-prices-ipo-at-29-per-share.html)\u2026and it's now trading at \\~$22.50\n* Anthem takes advantage of the Centene-WellCare deal and [**purchases the divested assets**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/anthem-scoops-up-centene-wellcare-divestitures/563780/) from the merger.\n* Heal, a medical house calls startup, [**acquires Doctors on Call**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/heal-a-medical-house-calls-startup-acquires-doctors-on-call/563573/)\n* Trinity Health [**may issue $1.7 billion in debt**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/trinity-health-may-issue-17-billion-debt) \\- about 22% of the system's total long term debt of $6.3 billion, per Modern Healthcare. Notably, around $1.4 billion of the debt is expected to be taxable bonds.\n* Uber And Lyft Ride-Sharing Services are growing a [**footprint in Medicaid**](https://khn.org/news/uber-and-lyft-hitch-onto-medicaid/). About 15% of rides in Arizona's Medicaid program were from one of the two. \n* OxyContin's solution to paying for the opioid crisis? [**Sell more opioids**](https://www.apnews.com/cd313598c3c8445b985089d05e060cbf).\n\n**State Hits**\n\n* In Louisiana, Ochsner and Lafayette General just [**announced plans to combine**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/ochsner-lafayette-general-ink-merger-plan-33-hospital-system) into a 33-hospital system in a pretty interesting deal. Along with the merger, the combination is pledging to invest $365 million in community investments/resources in the parishes they serve, including the expansion of key services.

        "content": "[News] Top healthcare news stories from the week of September 17: Apple, Google, Amazon, & others battle for the healthcare cloud, the good, bad, and ugly of hospital mergers, everything policy from the week, and the transforming PBM industry\n# 1. Battle for the Healthcare Cloud\n\n**Electronic Health Record Battle Royale.**\n\nThe battle is heating up between Big Tech titans as they [**compete for health data storage contracts**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-amazon-and-microsoft-in-battle-to-store-health-data-in-the-cloud-11568122202) (paywall - WSJ) with big-time health systems. As one of the final frontiers for Amazon, Google, and others, these Cloud contracts could get a foot in the door to work with healthcare folks that could result in long, lucrative relationships that expand beyond just the Cloud.\n\nRecent Cloud deals announced included [**Google and the Mayo Clinic**](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-selects-google-as-strategic-partner-for-health-care-innovation-cloud-computing/), Microsoft and [**Providence St. Joe'**](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/microsoft-providence-st-joseph-partner-long-term-cloud-innovation-project)s, and plenty of others. Generally, the agreements really are just for storage of healthcare and financial information. But we already know that Big Tech has plans to expand capabilities further, like including electronic health records and finding clinically useful information for trials and other treatments.\n\nOf course, these developments come with a slew of problems - namely, privacy concerns (shout out HIPAA) and security issues (healthcare companies literally get hacked all the time) so\u2026we'll see where it goes from here.\n\nTech firms don't care, though. How mad would shareholders be if they missed out on the market expected to reach $100 billion by 2025?\n\n\\---\n\n# 2. The Sobering Reality of Healthcare Tech?\n\n**Is a healthcare tech disruption in sight?**\n\nAll of this talk about Big Tech has me thinking\u2026how far ARE we from seeing true 'disruption' in healthcare?\n\nThe answer is\u2026.[**we're not quite there yet**](https://www.axios.com/health-tech-innovation-hype-poll-young-people-03d226d8-7442-43f2-80e5-e1e88190b280.html). As Axios reported this week, the healthcare system - and providers in general - have a bit of a ways to go to catch up technologically. We're moving in the right direction, but patients still don't really use much tech to actually benefit their health outcomes\u2026yet. And the end result of healthcare innovation might be a [**bit messier than we think**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/why-one-app-to-rule-them-all-is-not-the-future-of-digital-health/)**.**\n\nStill, there are plenty of positive and incremental takeaways each year. In its annual keynote, Apple [**announced 3 health studies**](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-announces-three-groundbreaking-health-studies/) \\- actual health studies - that will incorporate its Apple Watch in hearing, women's health, and heart health (maybe in response to [**this open letter**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-apple-open-letter-regarding-healthcare-from-schwartz-md/)? And there are plenty of promising medical device and similar startups that could revolutionize methods of treatment.\n\n**Bad actors.**\n\nDon't forget that reality always eventually sets in. Investors pouring money into the system might leave thoroughly empty handed. Just look at what happened with Theranos and now, uBiome's bankruptcy.\n\n\\---\n\n# 3. The good, the bad, and the ugly of hospital mergers\n\n**Controversy.**\n\nA report published from the AHA this week caused a bit of a stir from everyone, as its findings indicated that hospital mergers resulted in lower healthcare costs, among other assertions.\n\n**Opposing viewpoints.**\n\nEconomists [**disagreed with the view**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/aha-says-hospital-mergers-are-good-economists-say-otherwise.html), saying that mergers resulted in higher costs. Providers argue that mergers may be necessary in order to maintain leverage with insurers, improve operational performance, and provide better population health management.\n\nWhat do you think?

The Transforming PBM Industry\n\n**CVS Deal gets approved.**\n\nAfter a tumultuous 9 month run, a federal judge finally managed to [**approve the CVS-Aetna deal**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/federal-judge-signs-cvs-aetna-merger-after-post-deal-review) this week, paving the way for CVS to officially acquire Aetna (even though they've been operating as one entity for\u2026almost a year). The approval comes at a time when CVS, traditionally a PBM player, is trying to transform its business model and the healthcare industry - even [**hiring a former Fitbit exec**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/cvs-hires-fitbit-executive-to-lead-consumer-health.html) to lead its consumer health division.\n\n**Pharmacy Benefit Management's evolution?**\n\nIronically enough, though, the first industry to see significant change may be CVS' core business of pharmacy benefit management. New startups are springing up, aiming for more transparency around the typically-shady PBM practice and a generally more consumer-friendly approach to the business. And don't forget the heat the industry faced earlier this year from Capitol Hill.\n\nRead for yourself an [**interview with PBM startup Capsule's CEO**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pharmacy-industry-is-finally-seeing-a-much-needed-change-capsule-ceo-says.html), who talks about the changing industry.

Healthcare Policy Corner - Week of September 13\n\n**The Congress Strikes Back**\n\nHere's a preview of Congress' fall healthcare agenda:\n\n* Lowering prescription drug prices - potentially allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies\n   * [**Pelosi's Plan**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pelosi-s-draft-drug-pricing-plan-allows-direct-negotiation-imposes-fines.html), which includes the above direct negotiation tactic, might actually have bipartisan support\n* Finding a solution to **surprise medical bills**\n   * But as of now, it looks like Congress is [**facing major pushback**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/back-in-session-congress-faces-industry-pushback-on-surprise-billing/562518/) from industry leaders on surprise billing - from an extremely well-funded [**dark money group**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/13/health-groups-dark-money-hospital-bills-legislation-1495697). We might have to wait a bit for more surprise billing legislation.\n   * Look for more action at the state level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther healthcare things to look out for this fall:\n\nUnveiling Trump's healthcare plan (expanding Medicare Advantage, giving states more leeway, etc.)\n\nResolving Gun-control disputes\n\nIn other policy news, HHS is [**releasing $1.8 billion**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/hhs-releases-18-billion-funds-fight-opioid-epidemic) to combat the opioid epidemic.

And everything healthcare policy you missed!\n  \n\n# 1. Want cheaper surgery? Go on vacation.\n\n**An all-inclusive resor- er\u2026wait - hospital?**\n\nSave this wild story down for later. To reduce costs on healthcare, some employers - like Ashley Furniture - have been flying down patients ***along with*** physicians to Cancun, Mexico in order to perform surgeries and other procedures. \n\nAs KHN reports, one patient flew from Mississippi to meet an orthopedist from Milwaukee to perform a knee replacement surgery, and the patient was *paid for it* \\- that's how much less it was to have the procedure done in an upscale hospital in Mexico rather than in America. Like, literally less than half as much money. Absolutely wild! \n\n[**Read the whole story here**](https://khn.org/news/to-save-money-american-patients-and-surgeons-meet-in-cancun/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. The latest privacy battle: Patient DNA data?\n\n**The latest privacy battleground.**\n\nThis week, the [**Wall Street Journal reported**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deals-give-drugmakers-rights-to-dna-data-11565607602) (paywall) on recent hospital system and drug-maker partnerships to access patient DNA information. The partnerships are aimed at advancing drug development, or other research-oriented purposes. But they might not be the most forthcoming with patients as to how they're using patient data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How it works.**\n\nPatients are given a free genetic test that shows them risk of various diseases and vulnerabilities, but they're not necessarily told how their genetic data might specifically be used by companies for drug development or other commercial purposes.\n\nKeep an eye on this one as genetic sequencing becomes more commonplace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Is employer healthcare spending reaching a breaking point?\n\n**Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall\u2026.**\n\nHealthcare costs have risen for everyone - that's a given. But because the U.S. healthcare system is set up how it is, employers foot a larger portion of healthcare costs. In an interesting and detailed brief from Axios, it turns out that the [**system could be close to a breaking point**](https://www.axios.com/employers-health-care-costs-premiums-deductibles-9e074deb-467e-4e81-b0c3-97259324bfe6.html).\n\nAs these costs continued to rise for employers, companies shifted more of their healthcare costs to their employees (hello, high deductible health plans).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does shifting costs to us do?**\n\nOn top of an already high deductible, patients end up [**having higher premiums**](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/tracking-the-rise-in-premium-contributions-and-cost-sharing-for-families-with-large-employer-coverage/) along with more responsibility to pay for their medical bills. Given these set of facts, the rise of out of pocket spending and healthcare inflation could be unsustainable and lead to a crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Policy Corner\n\n**What's your plan??**\n\nDemocrats and basically everyone else were asking the Trump admin what the replacement healthcare policy would be if Obamacare were to fail in court in its 3rd victory lap around the Appellate Circuits. Never fear - Trump's health chief came out and let everyone know this week that officials were [**actively working on an Obamacare replacement**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/457574-trump-health-chief-officials-actively-working-on-obamacare-replacement-plan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Any details yet, or nah.**\n\nThe plan itself is skimpy on details so far, but we DO know that officials are targeting a September release date, and we would expect the plan to include certain elements like ending surprise billing, giving states more wiggle room on policies, potential drug pricing solutions, and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In other Trump news\u2026**\n\nThe administration just hit the brakes on a law that would have [**stopped 'unneeded' CT and MRI scans**](https://khn.org/news/trump-administration-delays-law-reducing-unnecessary-medicare-imaging-ct-scans-mris/), since officials faced some backlash from physicians who thought the policy was disruptive to their practices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cadillac Tax repeal.**\n\nFinally, it seems pretty likely that the Cadillac Tax, a tax on more 'generous' insurance plans, would be repealed this fall.

That demand could signify the hot market for healthcare data and payment management software.\n\nInterestingly, CommonSpirit Health owns a small stake in Conifer, which is something I didn\u2019t know before this story broke.\n\nThe transaction is supposed to take place by the second quarter of 2021, so still a decent ways away. Tenet wants to make sure that the spin-off transitions well and is tax-free for all parties involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In other Tenet news\u2026**\n\nThe hospital operator is looking to make a large investment in their Desert Health Network by offering to [purchase Desert Regional Medical Center](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/health/2019/07/18/tenet-makes-bid-purchase-desert-regional-medical-center-palm-springs/1773594001/) in Palm Springs for $320 \u2013 $380 million.\n\n## \n\n# 4.

[News]\n&#x200B;\n\n## Sanford and UnityPoint combine to create a huge Midwest system\n\n### A 26-state giant.\n\nThis week, Sanford and UnityPoint [**announced their intentions**](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/news/sanford-health-unitypoint/) to merge into a sprawling Midwest nonprofit giant. With the combined entity, the two health systems will boast 76 hospitals across 26 states, $11 billion in *operating* revenue, and significant heavyweight players in several markets (hello, North & South Dakota, Illinois, and Iowa) on their way to becoming one of the biggest 15 nonprofit health systems in the country.\n\n### Keep \u2019em coming.\n\nThe deal between the two Midwest giants is yet another example of [**hospital and nonprofit consolidation in healthcare**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/midwest-hospital-systems-to-merge-into-26-state-regional-giant-11561694580). Both systems plan to merge for strategic reasons, including improving operational efficiencies by leveraging strengths from each side.

Allergan\u2019s main claim to fame is Botox (heard of it?).\n\nSome investors are [**skeptical of the deal**](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/5-reasons-abbvie-bought-allergan-and-why-they-may-not-be-enough/557611/), since Botox, Allergan\u2019s best selling drug, is expected to see increased competition once its patent protections are up.\n\n### Biotech Boom.\n\nIt\u2019s been a good year for biotech M&A (and their investment bankers for that matter, probably).

Of the startups listed above, this one sounds the most intriguing to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n## Dems debate healthcare\n\n### A 2-night extravaganza.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all aware, the Democratic debate kicked off this past week with not one, but TWO nights of candidates grandstanding for attention.\n\n### Drug pricing reform?\n\nFrom the healthcare side, candidates easily agreed on the need for drug pricing reform, but an [**interesting divide emerged**](https://khn.org/news/medicare-for-all-emerges-as-early-divide-in-first-democratic-debate/) from those who supported Medicare for All type policies versus those who supported a more moderate approach to healthcare reform.\n\n### Medicare for All.\n\nElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders (of course) quickly threw weight behind the Medicare for All cause.

Whereas apps like Headspace and Calm are focused on meditation and mindfulness, newer platforms such as BetterHelp, a subsidiary of Teladoc and leader in the online therapy space (makes sense) and [**Talkspace**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/https:/techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/), which recently raised $50 million and is partnering with Optum, are bringing counseling and therapy services directly to your phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mental Health\u2019s growth.**\n\nThe apps point to a larger trend.

Just this week, the startup [**announced**](https://www.builtinnyc.com/2019/06/17/quartet-health-series-d-funding) a successful $60 million Series D funding round courtesy of Centene (another big Medicaid player). To date, Quartet Health has raised almost $153 million so far, which is only one example of not only the deep pockets of healthcare venture capital, but also the ease of fundraising in 2019.\n\n## \n\n## Are Patients a big part of the U.S. healthcare spending problem?\n\n**Fat Americans.**\n\nAn interesting article this week brought up a fascinating topic of discussion: should consumers be blamed at all for the high cost of healthcare in the U.S?\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I\u2019ll take a Big Mac.**\n\nThe Atlantic article [**published**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/american-health-care-spending/590623/) this week argued that Americans have unhealthy behaviors rooted in cultural norms, which leads to poorer outcomes for the population (hello, pizza night!). It goes on to state that Americans tend to be over-treated, disregard preventive and routine care, undergo dangerous elective surgeries, and treat physicians like deities. It concludes that a high cost healthcare system is enabled by the poor healthcare choices made by Americans.\n\nThe story only covers the consumer side of the healthcare cost argument, but it\u2019s an interesting perspective, and one not touched on as often.

While the vote was ultimately struck down, it was much closer than most expected \u2013 53% of participants voted against the policy.\n\nIn other developments, the AMA voted to [**adopt more technology and A.I. friendly policies**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ama-adopts-measures-to-shape-development-uptake-of-ai-systems-in-healthcar/556819/), including working toward developing applications for A.I. in healthcare, technology training for physicians, and generally deeper integration of tech in healthcare.\n\n## \n\n## Pfizer buys Array Biopharma in huge $11.4 billion deal\n\nIn a deal that led to an across the board biotech rally, Pfizer announced its intention to [**acquire Array BioPharma**](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Pfizer-to-Acquire-Array-BioPharma/default.aspx) for a total of $11.4 billion, or $48 per share \u2013 which is a gigantic 60ish% premium over its most recent share price.\n\nArray was a pretty attractive buyout option given its super innovative cancer therapies along with its licensed revenues and medicines.\n\nIt\u2019s been a pretty good 30ish months for biotech M&A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n## California expands health insurance to illegal immigrants\n\n**On the taxpayers\u2019 dime?!?!?!**\n\nThis week, California [**unveiled**](https://www.axios.com/california-health-benefits-for-some-immigrants-8b7e6ab0-0b3e-4674-9aec-5248ce1ee42c.html) a public health plan that would be made available for illegal immigrants in the state. The plan would more or less be an extension of Medicaid and is expected to cover about 90,000 19 to 25 year old individuals.

Just telling my story and asking a general question about medical technology, hope mods wont remove the post, thanks.\n\nHi, I would appreciate any input regarding my situation. This is not a \"diagnose me\" question, and I understand it may be taken down. I asked here, since I assume there are a few medical proffesionals here.\n\nDont be afraid to give me \"bad\" honest answers - for example, \"science is nowhere near regenerating spinal joints etc\"\n\nMy MAIN question is this - where do you guys see \"regenerative\" medicine in 20+ years? Especially regarding bone disorders - osteoartritis, spinal stenosis etc.\n\nMy story. Very physicaly active childhood, sports, weigtlifting etc.\n\nPreexisting conditions/injuries\n\na - flat foot\n\nb - no natural curvature in lower spine - flat back\n\nc - hip inpingement from childhood - FAI\n\nd - 3 metre fall on upper back, which started my pain story. 5 years ago, when I was 22\n\nIn short - a,b,c have played some part in my spinal/hip/knee osteoartritis. I played a lot of basketball/volleyball and my body just isnt built to absorb impact I guess. A,b,c my have caused my spine/knees/hips to degenerate faster than they should.\n\n5 years ago fell on my upper back. Stopped lifting due to pain, started running/bodyweight training.\n\n6 months later hips and elbows started to hurt. Did MRI for back/hips/knees - all show osteoarthritis in spine, hips, knee, elbow, right wrist and tendinopathy in my elbows/achilles/hamstring etc.\n\nStopped all activities. For last 4 years have been on/off physical therapy. It is HARD to motivate myself, because physical therapy makes by back hurt MORE after exercise.\n\nHips/knees hurt LESS after physical therapy - go figure.\n\nLong story short - I am suicidal - hips/knees/elbows DONT bother me as much, its the f****** BACK. If I lay in bed all day it hurts less, then if I try to stay active/mobile.\n\nBack pain has destroyed my libido, taken my job from me, relationships and my joy. Not to mention I have almost no close family... - my mother died young, an alcoholic, my father didnt raise me, but we are decent with communication, not friends, but I guess OK. My grandparents, who raised me, are nearing their death and they are the only ones keeping me alive right now.\n\nI could never hurt them by taking my life before them, taking into account they have already lost their daughter - my mom.\n\nMy vertebrae havent fused yet and I dont have stenosis, but I guess they are very likely in the future.\n\nMy question is, - and this is the only thing that gives me hope - can I look forward to technology to save me from pain in future?\n\nI mean - if I was told that I will have this pain forever, and exercise wont help, I would just wait for my grandparents to pass away and either off myself or use euthanasia clinic offer - I am sure I qualify.\n\nThe possibility of cure in future and spending at least a few active years without pain - that would be amazing and would motivate me to endure the pain. Other thing would be having children - but taking into account my current state, it would be extremely immoral to have a child just to have a reason to live..\n\nI apologize for my badly strucutred text and if my English wasnt perfect, it is not my native language. And I am having a bad day today, thus the \"rant\"...\n\nThank you and best of luck to everyone - take care of your health guys..",

I\u2019m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women\u2019s health.\n\nWe just put out the second episode of our two-part series on the U.S. maternal mortality crisis. Part I explored how race plays a role in this crisis\u2013 it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Part II looks at how the key players in the space are working to fix the problem.\n\n\"We designed the birth environment to resemble an ICU,\" says Dr. Neel Shah of Ariadne Labs on this week's episode. Something needs to change on the way we care for women during labor.\n\nStep one is getting good data and we'll explore how the country finally seems ready to study this epidemic on a national scale with the introduction of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, passed without much fanfare at the end of 2018. But waiting for all the data to roll in will\u00a0inevitably\u00a0mean more women will die in the meantime, so it's not surprising that people are already working on solutions, most of which involve restoring humanity to the birthing mother\u2013 sounds simple, but technology and complex healthcare systems have trumped the basics of birth.\n\nToday's episode is packed with important facts and powerful interviews. From Washington Rep. Herrera Beutler to a woman who almost died after having her son, we will do our best to tell this complicated story that impacts all of us. \u00a0\n\nData collection, bias taught in medical school, government intervention, moms advocating for other moms, rouge-OB determined to disrupt the status quo, a not-for-profit invested in getting this right and one mother's story of how she almost died\u2013 we get into it all in just an hour.

        "content": "5 Big Healthcare Stories, Week of April 30, 2019 - PBMs Exposed, Stocks Bounce Back, and Primary Care Transformation [News]\nHi everyone - here's my picks for the biggest healthcare stories from the past week. As always, please let me know if you have any thoughts or if I missed anything!\n\n  \n\n**1. CMS Inpatient Payment Proposal Released**\n\n**Inpatient payments boosted by 3.7%. Site neutral payment phase-in.**\n\nThis week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (AKA CMS) released its (their?) [**proposed 2020 ruling**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/cms-proposed-inpatient-payment-rule-for-2020-9-things-to-know.html) for the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The IPPS designates Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers for inpatient care. Note that this ruling is just the *proposed* changes to Medicare payments - the final ruling comes out later in the year. Still, the proposed changes give insight into what CMS wants to incentivize for inpatient providers. From Beckers, major highlights from the proposed ruling included the following:\n\n* 3.2% increase for acute care hospitals that report quality data metrics to CMS and use their electronic health records in a [**meaningful way**](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/meaningful-use-and-macra/meaningful-use-and-macra)**;**\n* 3.7% total estimated rate increase for all inpatient providers, when taking into account all new payment policies and uncompensated care;\n* About a 2.6% increase in hospital DSH payments (we've covered this before in our [**January 11 edition - 5th story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/weekly-muse-1-11-2019/) \\- payments for hospitals that have a higher proportion of charity care patients);\n* [**Site neutral payment**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/12-things-to-know-about-site-neutral-payments.html) adjustments for hospital outpatient departments, which could have [**much broader implications on health system consolidation**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/23/716110288/hospitals-chafe-under-a-medicare-rule-that-reduces-payments-to-far-flung-clinics) (FYI, hospitals are NOT pleased about this change) in addition to decreased physician employment by hospitals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rural hospital relief.**\n\nAmong the more interesting changes, CMS seems to be [**extending a lifeline to rural hospitals**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-proposes-wage-index-change-to-help-prop-up-rural-hospitals/553304/), making adjustments to the wage index adjustment in addition to the floor payment that rural hospitals may receive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Healthcare Stocks Bounce Back**\n\n**That didn\u2019t take long.**\n\nEased by strong healthcare earnings reports from the likes of [**Centene**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centenes-membership-growth-fuels-q1-as-ceo-updates-divestiture-plan/553264/), [**UnitedHealth**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-q1-earnings.html), [**Anthem**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-raises-outlook-despite-concerns-over-political-environment-11556125302), [**Encompass**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encompass-health-reports-results-for-first-quarter-2019-and-reiterates-full-year-2019-guidance-300838718.html), and [**others**](http://fundamentalis.com/?p=8901), healthcare stocks came roaring back this week. [**Last week, we covered the dramatic sell-off**](https://www.healthymuse.email/4-22-2019/) of these same stocks. The existential risk stemming from Medicare for All once again resurfaced after the proposed system was admonished as a \"disruptive\" threat to the economy on [**UnitedHealth's Q1 earnings call.** ](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-group-inc-unh-q1-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Buy the dip.**\n\nHealthcare analysts were [**un-perturbed**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-22/goldman-says-health-care-options-showing-little-fear-amid-rout), though, calling it a baseless selloff. Remember that healthcare [**sold in droves**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-stocks-between-2020-and-a-hard-place-11555927381) (paywall - WSJ) before the 2016 election, too. People don't like uncertainty, and healthcare has quite a bit of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare Risks.**\n\nCurrent legislation is not without its effects on public and private healthcare companies. This week, S&P released its [**global healthcare credit ratings report**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/hhs-proposals-possible-congressional-legislation-may-hurt-healthcare-credit-ratings-s-p-says.html), which lists a few risks facing the industry this year. S&P expects policy changes this year in the areas of balance billing and drug pricing rebates, which would affect physician services companies like Envision and MedNax, and pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts, CVS, and UNH, respectively. Funnily enough, S&P has no faith in healthcare reform, at least for now: of all the current legislation and policy proposals out there, the firm lists ACA repeal and Medicare for All as extremely unlikely to happen within the next few years. It makes sense, given the current administration and the Senate makeup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. State of Washington Bill Restricts Nurse's Shifts**\n\n**A Hot Amendment Mess.**\n\nSHB 1155 was intended to be a bill that would help nurses out - mandating that nurses working in hospitals would be given uninterrupted breaks during their shifts. But the bill took a drastic turn when a senator proposed a wild amendment that [**suddenly morphed SHB 1155**](https://mynorthwest.com/1353563/washington-senate-catastrophic-nurse-shifts/) into an entirely different beast - changing nursing shifts from 3, 12 hour shifts a week to 5, 8 hour shifts a week (what's the grammatically correct way to structure that sentence, anyway? Someone PLEASE let me know). Now, hospitals and nurses alike are banding together ([**a rare occurrence, really**](https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2018/07/16/nurses-strikes-nurses-feeling-overworked-across-country/783587002/)) to oppose the bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Backlash from the Bill's passage.**\n\nThe Washington State Hospital Association (AKA the WSHA) had some strong words to say on the bill: *\"If SHB 1155 passes as amended, I am confident that hospitals will not be able to meet the care needs of their communities. Patients will suffer especially in emergencies. This would be terrible for the patients of Washington state.\"* It's interesting to note that the WSHA ***INITIALLY*** opposed the bill, too. Now, the association ironically has the support of nurses across the state of Washington as they try to maintain their 3 day work weeks, an amenity that nurses greatly enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. PBMs Taking Advantage of Medicaid?**\n\n**Drug Pricing Contagion.**\n\nA [**new report from 46 Brooklyn**](https://www.46brooklyn.com/research/2019/4/21/new-pricing-data-reveals-where-pbms-and-pharmacies-make-their-money) analyzed various generic specialty drugs covered by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) under Ohio's managed Medicaid program (i.e., Ohio essentially lets insurance companies run Medicaid for them). After matching state drug utilization data against PBM drug cost data, the 46 Brooklyn report found that PBMs appeared to be marking up generic specialty drugs (a practice known as [**spread pricing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-drug-spread-pricing/)) by a total of almost $11 million in one quarter alone by controlling the specialty pharmacy market. As a result, Ohio's Medicaid program probably way overpaid for these drugs, and cost the state's taxpayers big bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Broader ramifications.**\n\nIf it's happening in the Ohio managed Medicaid program, it's probably happening elsewhere, too. The report concludes by stating SOME transparency in healthcare (specifically, drug pricing) is not enough. 46 Brooklyn called for a 100% transparent system to spur competition and bring to light the secretive pricing practices that PBMs seem to engage in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The PBM Defense.**\n\nAs [**Axios reported**](https://www.axios.com/specialty-pharmacies-drug-prices-medicaid-9f422bdb-4cb7-479b-a7da-a6ea02abb1e6.html), the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (AKA pro-PBMs) gave a [**strong response**](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5976111-PCMA-Statement-on-46brooklyn-Report.html) to the analysis. The PCMA claimed that the data was 'cherry-picked' questioned the reliability of its data sources, and stated that the analysis did not take into account rebates, discounts, or overall plan outcomes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. HHS Proposes 'Transformative' Primary Care Models**\n\n**A new primary care path forward.**\n\nThis week, HHS and CMS [**announced new initiatives**](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-news-hhs-deliver-value-based-transformation-primary-care) designed primarily to lower administrative costs and consequently allow physicians more time with patients. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tell me about these initiatives.**\n\nThe proposal will have five payment models under 2 different systems - Primary Care First, and Direct Contracting. Primary Care First (PCF) seems to be more or less a value-based (i.e., patient outcome-driven) [**capitation**](https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/about-internal-medicine/career-paths/residency-career-counseling/guidance/understanding-capitation) type model - where a physician will receive monthly lump payments adjusted for his or her patient base's acuity levels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about the Direct Contracting model?**\n\nWhile the PCF models are more focused on individualized primary care practices, Direct Contracting (DC) models will be focused more-so on patient populations. DC models will partner with ACOs, managed care plans, and other population health managers to give these plan providers various \"risk\" options. Based on the level of \"risk\" they choose, the DC model will reimburse them fixed monthly payments of varying amounts. For instance, if an insurer chose a \"riskier\" payment option, the insurer would receive a higher fixed payment up front from Medicare, but they would also be on the hook if catastrophic disease rampaged their population/covered lives. It all depends on how these participants manage financial risk versus receiving fixed, predictable revenue streams.\n\nThese new models were introduced in an attempt to reduce overall healthcare costs and to see whether these types of models would produce better outcomes for patients. We'll see!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What else?**\n\nIn other primary care news, Humana announced the launch of its new virtual care model, partnering with Doctor on Demand to form its On Hand health plan. In its [**press release**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190424005233/en/), Humana touted the plan's capabilities to lower healthcare costs and lower monthly premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quick Hits**\n\nCivica Rx [**opened its headquarters**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hospital-led-generic-drug-company-civica-rx-opens-headquarters/553077/) this week in Lehi, Utah. The nonprofit generic drug initiative plans to address drug shortages in over 900 hospitals, with ambitious plans to supply up to 14 generics in its first year in operation. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made some [**perplexing comments**](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/aoc-praises-chronically-dysfunctional-va-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it) about the Veterans Affairs' healthcare system this week. Amid nationwide political action and backlash, Walgreens [**raised the minimum age**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/04/23/amid-fda-crackdown-walgreens-will-raise-age-to-21-for-tobacco-purchases/) of purchasing tobacco products to 21.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's something you don't hear every day. MD Anderson [**kicked out 3 Chinese scientists**](https://www.apnews.com/7767d6b9423c4b6892576cb0619101eb) over fears of data/intellectual theft. So much for collaboration! Amazon [**started to market**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/meet-pillpack-amazon-rolls-out-rx-delivery-direct-marketing/553364/) its direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical business, PillPack (something we touched on in our [**2nd story Feb. 11 edition**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-2-8-2019/)), with free delivery for Prime members. Speaking of tech companies, Google is continuing to try to [**crack into healthcare**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/22/712778514/google-searches-for-ways-to-put-artificial-intelligence-to-use-in-health-care) by looking for new ways to implement its AI technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chinese are [**coming**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmakers-brace-for-sales-to-slow-in-china-amid-generic-drug-push-11556279387) for our drugs market (paywall - WSJ). Home Health Care News had a [**great piece on LHC Group**](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/04/how-lhc-group-quietly-acquired-an-aco-management-company-doubled-aco-activity/) this week on how the company is leveraging its Accountable Care Organization in its business strategy and population health management. You're more likely to die in the [**good 'ole South**](https://www.axios.com/cdc-death-rates-heart-disease-cancer-south-usa-d03996c0-803f-45cc-92ad-4536df0e1a88.html). And Anthem and UnitedHealth are [**about to spar**](https://medcitynews.com/2019/04/anthem-and-unitedhealth-group-among-top-competitors-to-acquire-magellan-health/?rf=1) over the acquisition of Magellan Health, a fellow managed care player.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the Washington legislature passes its [**emergency room surprise-billing law**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/washington-legislature-passes-surprise-billing-law.html). Providers and payors will now be forced to arbitration for any out of network bills that patients receive. Keep an eye on Colorado too, as the state [**looks to pass a similar bill**](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/03/06/health-in-out-of-network-medical-bills-colorado/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\nThanks for reading!

        "content": "Healthcare's 5 Biggest Stories, Week of April Fools - Trump goes for the Obamacare Jugular, Centene buys WellCare, New York bans Unvaccinated Children, and more. [News]\nHey everyone! Back again this week with the top healthcare stories. As always, let me know if you think I missed anything big:\n\n# 1 New York Suburb Bans Unvaccinated Children from the Public\n\n**That seems drastic.**\n\nThis week, Rockland County, a suburb of New York, declared a [**state of emergency**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html) based on the rampant [**measles outbreak**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/measles-outbreak-jews-nyc.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) facing their county's population. The first step? Banning all unvaccinated children and teenagers from public places. This type of action is pretty unprecedented, but so is getting the measles. Although the measles vaccine is about 97% effective, only 72% of the Rockland adolescent population is vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. The ban comes at a time when measles cases through the first 3 months of the year [**have already outpaced**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/us-measles-cases-surpass-2018-totals-as-outbreaks-spread.html) last year's total reported cases altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2 PBMs going to testify before Congress Wednesday 4/3\n\n**This week's hottest TV.**\n\nTune in to the Senate finance committee hearing this Wednesday to see some absolutely heart-pounding, riveting, must-see TV. Last month in our [**March 4th edition**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-3-4-2019/), we covered lawmakers inviting drugmakers to Capitol Hill to ask why drug costs were so high. Those companies placed 100% of the blame onto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are basically the middlemen between the makers and the patients. Now, the Senate wants to [**ask PBMs some questions**](https://www.axios.com/cvs-trump-drug-pricing-rebate-plan-51bd0100-9be3-4bd7-804a-da9948057533.html) about their drug rebate practices and whether they're ACTUALLY saving patients money on drugs. Companies like CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna are preparing to get grilled come Wednesday, especially as Congress prepares potential legislation around [**abolishing drug rebate practices for good**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/squeeze-looks-more-likely-for-drug-middlemen-11553530346) (paywall).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3 Trump goes for the jugular on Obamacare\n\n**Fuel to the political fire.**\n\nAs if declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional weren't enough, the Trump administration has now declared its intent to [**completely repeal and replace the ACA**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/436153-gop-senators-blindsided-by-trump-on-obamacare)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remind me - what's going on right now?**\n\nIn 2018, the tax bill repealed the ACA's individual mandate, meaning that people who opted not to have health insurance would not longer be penalized for doing so. After this happened, several states took the ACA to court in Texas late in December of last year. In that hearing, a judge [**ruled against the ACA**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/the-affordable-care-act-ruled-unconstitutional-by-tx-federal-judge.html), declaring the entire bill unconsitutional now that the individual mandate wasn't a thing. Of course, the ruling was appealed and is still tied up in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supreme Court Inbound.**\n\nWith heated debates surrounding healthcare on both sides of the aisle, it seems as if a Supreme Court showdown is almost inevitable. Trump thinks he's in good standing considering the currently conservative lean of the bench. But that raises the question - if the lawsuit against the ACA is successful, [**what comes next for healthcare**](https://www.axios.com/justice-trump-court-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-ab8bf281-65fc-4b91-8606-d1f3f65818d6.html)? Because it doesn't look like there's any proposed system to take the ACA's place. The debate around healthcare will only intensify as the administration turns up the heat and 2020 approaches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Centene buys WellCare in $17 billion deal\n\n**A Medicaid Giant.**\n\nCentene [**secured**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centene-17b-wellcare-buy-will-boost-medicare-footprint/551411/) plans this week to purchase its main competitor, WellCare, in a $17.3 billion deal (a 32% premium to their share price). The merger comes at a time when mega-sized healthcare firms are joining forces pretty frequently (think CVS / Aetna, Cigna / Express Scripts, and a whole host of others). What's different about these firms, though, is that they've made their killing mainly by managing Medicaid programs for states. Their businesses really took off under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed for expansion of Medicaid, and thus, the expansion of Centene's and WellCare's businesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not so fast.**\n\nBecause this transaction is a huge 'horizontal' merger in a highly regulated area, this deal is highly likely to raise antitrust concerns. Also, as we just covered above, any existential threat to the ACA would probably REALLY hamstring any further growth available to the new company. If the deal does go through, look for these companies to leverage their size and aggressively target the Medicare Advantage market. Like we talked about in our [**February 11th 3rd story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-2-8-2019/), Medicare Advantage is growing like a weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 UPS Enters the Home Care Market\n\n**Robots and Drones.**\n\nAs a part of UPS' push into autonomous technology, the parcel giant is partnering with the drone company Matternet to [**deliver lab samples**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ups-teams-up-with-drone-startup-to-deliver-medical-samples-at-north-carolin/551487/) in North Carolina. The pilot program is part of a larger push from UPS into diversifying its revenue streams and changing home delivery as a whole. The approach is pretty innovative. If successful, the program could help seniors receive better and quicker care, all while pushing the lab industry toward an on-demand future (sound familiar, Theranos?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\nKeep on the look out for Johnson & Johnson's new drug ad, which will [**disclose**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-to-air-first-tv-ad-for-drug-that-discloses-its-price-11553786572) the cost of a drug for the first time on TV. Following last week's story on the FDA's [**secret medical device database**](https://khn.org/news/hidden-fda-database-medical-device-injuries-malfunctions/), watchdog groups are now [**calling**](https://khn.org/news/device-safety-experts-to-fda-make-data-public/) on the FDA to make all device data public. The FDA's also looking into the [**safety of breast implants**](https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2019%2F03%2F25%2Fhealth%2Fbreast-implant-safety-fda-bn%2Findex.html&formCheck=2b937809913e1c5103fda061e4c06437).

        "content": "[Discussion] Is this a stupid idea?\n Hi guys,\n\nSo I'm going to have my gap year before medical school coming up and I was interested in spending some time taking online classes towards either an MBA or a MS in Information Systems. I'm doing it for a back up plan in case my license gets revoked in the future. I'm thinking if something bad happens, then I'll just get moved over into something more administrative or maybe I'll enter Emergency Medicine and want to quit some day in the future. I'm basically just trying to secure my future in case anything goes bad. I feel like an MBA with a background in health administration would help in that regard.\n\nHowever, I am interested in information technology and was thinking about getting an information systems master's degree. I heard that the degree has business applications, so I'm wondering if it would serve the same purpose as a health administration degree. Would I be able to get a job in healthcare administration with an information systems degree? Is it even worth it? What would you do? Not sure what path to follow.",

        "content": "5 Big Healthcare Stories, Week of March 18 - Apple Watch passes its test, Trump's healthcare budget, and huge nonprofits link up [News]\nHi everyone! I'm back again this week with healthcare's top stories. Here we go!\n\nEdit: Thanks a ton to whoever gave me gold!!\n\n# 5 Big Healthcare Stories\n\n*Week of March 18, 2019*\n\n## \n\n## 1 Apple\u2019s Watches are Pretty Good at Heart Monitoring\n\n**WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.**\n\nOver the week, Stanford Medicine announced the results of a [**collaborative study**](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/03/apple-heart-study-demonstrates-ability-of-wearable-technology.html) to determine whether the Apple Watch was actually effective in monitoring for heart rate irregularities (atrial fibrillation). As it turns out, the Apple Watch did a pretty good job in detecting irregularities, even standing its ground against more rigorous heart monitors (an EKG patch). In fact, Apple\u2019s algorithm was found to have about a 71% positive predictive value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But what about the other 30% and false positives?**\n\nA key [**concern**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/apple-heart-study-early-proof-of-concept-or-a-bit-of-a-gimmick/550724/) of the highly touted Apple Watch EKG feature centered around whether the false positives the Watch sometimes gave would over-burden the healthcare system and make cardiologists even busier. This study somewhat debunked that claim, stating that Apple\u2019s algorithm (NOT the EKG monitor, mind you) was pretty predictive and effective at finding heart irregularities. Finally, [**according to the study**](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/technology/434383-major-us-study-finds-apple-watch-can-detect-heart-issues), only 0.5% of 400,000 (2,000ish people for you math wizards) study participants received irregular notifications, so it\u2019s not as if a rampant portion of the population is going to be stampeding into the doctor\u2019s office demanding to see a cardiologist.\n\n## \n\n## 2. The FDA is\u2026 Keeping Secrets?\n\n**For all the conspiracy theorists out there.**\n\nSo the FDA maintains a public database of all of the available medical devices that includes safety reports, injuries caused by those devices, and various other problems that any medical device might have been reported for. Except that might not actually be the case \u2013 Kaiser Health reported that the FDA may actually, in fact, maintain a [**separate database**](https://khn.org/news/hidden-fda-database-medical-device-injuries-malfunctions/)hidden from public view. According to Kaiser, some medical devices can be granted \u2018exemption\u2019 from this public database, and be stored in the \u2018hidden\u2019 database instead under a guise called \u2018[**Alternative Summary Reports**](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm072029.htm).\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sounds fishy.**\n\nThe issue came to light when a physician\u2019s medical stapler locked up during an appendectomy. Puzzled, he searched the FDA\u2019s database for the malfunction and came up empty handed. After surveying his peers, though, he found that quite a few had discovered a similar problem with the device. The whole situation is rather bizarre. Even a former FDA commissioner had no idea the separate database existed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mystery solved.**\n\nThe FDA [**responded**](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/LetterstoHealthCareProviders/ucm632938.htm) to the report and cleared up the medical stapler reporting issue along with Alternative Summary Reporting regulations. The administration stated that these medical stapler devices were not eligible for the Alternative Summary report program and would investigate the matter. Maybe not the complete response we were looking for, but it\u2019s something.\n\n[**The Healthy Muse is healthcare's best newsletter.**](http://healthymuse.email/)\n\n## 3. Trump\u2019s Healthcare Budget Cuts\n\n**A budget with major implications.**\n\nThe Trump administration released its 2020 budget plan this week and included some very ambitious healthcare changes. The [**proposed budget**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/trump-admin-proposes-massive-cuts-to-medicaid-medicare/550224/) would cut $845 billion from Medicare (an entitlement program) and $241 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years, including a $1.4 trillion cut to Medicaid. This cut would be almost completely offset, though, by a $1.2 trillion proposal to begin \u2018block grants\u2019 for Medicaid \u2013 meaning that each state would get a lump sum from Uncle Sam to run their Medicaid programs. The budget also indicates a desire to move toward a \u2018[**site neutral**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/12-things-to-know-about-site-neutral-payments.html)\u2018 payment policy for [**post-acute facilities**](http://skillednursingnews.com/2019/03/trump-budget-plan-would-cut-845b-from-medicare-241b-from-medicaid/) (think skilled nursing, inpatient rehab, home health).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other big budget highlights** included the following:\n\n* Increased push for Medicaid work requirements (i.e., prove that you\u2019re working to get Medicaid coverage);\n* Lower prescription drug spending through capping seniors\u2019 out of pocket drug costs;\n* Raised funding for veterans affairs medical care (in the magnitude of 10%)\n* Major cuts to the National Institute of Health (very unpopular);\n* More funds to combat the opioid epidemic;\n* Higher effort to fight and eradicate HIV/AIDS; and\n* Increased taxation of e-cig companies that would help fund FDA oversight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let\u2019s slow down.**\n\nThis budget\u2019s likelihood of getting passed through Congress is akin to me winning the Powerball on Wednesday, so take all of the above with a grain of salt. Still, it\u2019s important to know what the current administration is targeting and prioritizing. Keep these talking points in mind. Also, another government shutdown is probably coming this fall, so we have that to look forward to.\n\n## \n\n## 4. Cambia and BCBS North Carolina Link Up\n\n**That\u2019s pretty big.**\n\nTell me about it. Two large not for profit healthcare companies, Cambia (which could be described as something of a healthcare \u2018conglomerate\u2019) and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (a health insurance company) are joining forces to create a $16 [**billion behemoth**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cambia-bcbs-of-north-carolina-link-to-form-16b-insurer/550340/)(yeah, look at that alliteration). The joint company, retaining the name Cambia, will cover over 6 million people. The merger is a bit interesting, considering most of the companies under the Blue Cross Blue Shield umbrella haven\u2019t participated much in healthcare consolidation. Still, this merger is the latest culprit in the [**vertical integration trend**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/optum-unitedhealth-vertical-integration-walmart/520410/).\n\n## \n\n## 5. PAC Men Join Forces\n\n**The dynamic duo.**\n\nMedPAC and MACPAC (almost like Mr. and Mrs. Pacman, no?) are [exploring](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medpac-eyes-changes-to-ed-coding-part-b-drug-pricing/550180/) different ways to tackle healthcare costs this week. Specifically, they\u2019re eyeing potential changes to ED billing practices, drug pricing associated with Medicare Part B (think physicians and hospital outpatient departments), and the amount that the Feds can reimburse hospitals for taking on charity care patients (this program is known as DSH, or \u2018[disproportionate share payments](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Disproportionate_share_hospital),\u2019 which is something we [touched on](https://maddenmusings.com/weekly-muse-1-11-2019/) in our 5th story from the week of January 11). These proposals are more specific in nature, considering they\u2019re coming from organizations that know healthcare in a very detailed manner. As a result, Congress might pay more attention to the ideas the PACmen are considering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Quick Hits\n\nHCA [**acquires**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190314005829/en/HCA-Healthcare-Acquire-Majority-Ownership-Position-Galen) Galen College of Nursing, giving them access to a big labor pipeline to shield against any potential nursing shortages. Planet Money [**explores**](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/03/12/702500408/are-doctors-overpaid) whether doctors are overpaid. Here\u2019s a [**history**](https://www.merchantmedicine.com/marketreport/2019/3/14/looking-back-and-planning-forward) of urgent cares and what to expect moving forward from major players. And keep an eye on a new cloud-based healthcare startup [**set to IPO**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startup-livongo-eyes-2019-ipo-11551967202) later this year, Livongo (paywall \u2013 WSJ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund built a pretty [**nifty tool**](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/medicare-all-continuum) to compare the different healthcare reform ideas floating out there right now. How much do Americans at [**different ages**](https://digg.com/2019/american-healthcare-spending-by-age) spend on healthcare? Meet the [**new FDA commissioner**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/12/ned-sharpless-director-of-the-national-cancer-institute-to-be-named-acting-fda-commissioner/) \u2013 Ned Sharpless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPharmacy Benefit Management companies are the next up to get [**called to Capitol Hill**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/pbms-called-to-give-patients-an-explanation-by-senate-panel/550363/)(remember, drug companies just testified 2 weeks ago and blamed the drug pricing problem completely on these guys). Johnson & Johnson lost a baby powder case and is [**on the hook**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/14/jury-orders-johnson--johnson-to-pay-29-million-in-cancer-trial.html)for a $29 million fine (they\u2019ll appeal, of course).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!

I'm back again with the 5 biggest healthcare stories from the week. As always, let me know if I missed anything or if you have any feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you want to catch up on last week's post,\u00a0[**Go Here.**](https://maddenmusings.com/healthy-muse-2-25-2019/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 Big Healthcare Stories\n\n*Week of March 4, 2019*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 1. Congress\u2019 Big Beef with Big Pharma\n\n**Go see the Principal.**\n\nSome of Big Pharma\u2019s largest drug companies received a [**good ole\u2019 talking to**](https://www.axios.com/senate-finance-big-pharma-ceos-drug-prices-259fac5c-6bc4-4a86-b34f-e6539928e76a.html) from Uncle Sam this week. Congressional leaders heard testimonies from top executives from AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Meyers-Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Sanofi as they discussed and dissected the problem of rampant, belligerent drug prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what happened?**\n\nCongress asked Big Pharma about drug prices and even shot some flack at the industry\u2019s practices. Their concerns (putting it mildly) included rapid drug price hikes (in the order of thousands of percentages), patent-protecting strategies to try and extend drug monopolies (therefore delaying competition/supply for these drugs), and [**scapegoating**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/26/capitol-hill-warns-pharma-americans-are-tired-of-the-blame-game/) other parts of the healthcare industry rather than taking any of the blame themselves ([**namely, insurers and PBMs**](https://www.axios.com/pharmacy-benefit-managers-feeling-squeeze-2019-a9630150-07c8-4912-9484-ecd1b8770467.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pointing Fingers.**\n\nDrugmakers responded by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 deflecting. Essentially, the executives blamed the system as a whole for the drug pricing problem and explained that there were various [**incentives**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/drug-industry-defense-for-high-prices-blame-insurance-companies/2019/02/25/cc0151ce-35e7-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html) implicit within the healthcare system to price drugs higher. When asked why other countries paid less than the U.S. for drugs, the execs claimed that America foots the bill for other countries and that the world would have much less drug innovation if this were not the case. They [**pointed out**](https://khn.org/news/pharma-execs-dig-in-for-a-fight-against-outraged-senators/) that the costs of research and development, along with bringing drugs to market, can be quite high, and quite risky. The drugmakers also made clear that any over-regulation of U.S. prices could potentially threaten patient access to drugs, along with future breakthrough drug innovations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alright\u2026what now?**\n\nGood question. Not sure. Right now there are a few proposals being floated around in Capitol Hill. The [**first**](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/20190131_42-CFR-Part-1001.pdf) would force PBMs (think CVS, Walgreens) to return 100% of the rebates that they negotiate to the patient. Drug makers LOVE this idea. A second proposal \u2013 one\u00a0 that Big Pharma doesn\u2019t like nearly as much \u2013 would [**tie drug payments**](https://www.cms.gov/sites/drupal/files/2018-10/10-25-2018%20CMS-5528-ANPRM.PDF) to a \u2018basket\u2019 of international country drug payments. Another idea being floated around would involve Medicare directly negotiating with drugmakers on price. The bottom line is that everyone simply wants more transparency when it comes to healthcare prices in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 2. The BMY Investors Strike Back\n\n**Anyone else hot in here?**\n\nRemember when biotech giant Bristol-Myers-Squibb (jeez, that\u2019s a mouthful \u2013 let\u2019s abbreviate that bad boy to $BMY) [**announced**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bristol-myers-squibb-agrees-to-acquire-celgene-for-about-74-billion-2019-01-03) that they were acquiring fellow brother-biotech giant Celgene? Well, apparently Starboard, who is a big shareholder in BMY, is [**NOT on board**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/celgene-stock-falls-8-after-top-bristol-myers-squibb-holder-opposes-deal-2019-02-27) with the $74 billion decision. They think the deal is super risky, and told BMY management so. Citing expiring patents (especially on Celgene\u2019s biggest moneymaker, Revlimid), a risky drug pipeline, a large debt load, and historically poor management execution on BMY\u2019s operations (talk about a kick to the pants), Starboard claimed that BMY doesn\u2019t have the right or the track record to close the biggest biotech acquisition of all time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All aboard!**\n\nThey\u2019re not the only ones, either. Other activist investors with large stakes are now hopping on the \u2018no-go\u2019 train. Wellington Management, who owns 8% of BMY, thinks they\u2019re [**getting**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/27/celgene-falls-8-percent-after-wellington-management-says-it-opposes-bristol-myers-acquisition.html) a raw deal. BMY responded to the pushback, claiming that they\u2019re paying a fair price for Celgene, which includes the access to very specialized cancer drugs and new experimental gene therapies. Now, they\u2019re trying to [**smooth out**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/bristol-meets-with-investors-to-salvage-74-billion-celgene-deal.html) the wrinkles with their investors to make sure the deal still gets done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 3 Medicaid work requirements gain steam\n\n**A Separate Path.**\n\nWyoming is the latest state to [consider ](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/431258-wyoming-moves-closer-to-medicaid-work-requirement)Medicaid work requirements, a program where individuals must prove a certain threshold of hours worked per week in order to be covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid program. States like Kentucky have already passed similar-type bills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speaking of Medicaid\u2026**\n\nThe American College of Physicians came out in [support ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/02/28/big-doctor-group-supports-medicare-and-medicaid-buy-ins/#76b379432a77)of the Medicaid Buy-In program this week, something that has gained quite a bit of [traction ](https://khn.org/news/progressives-tout-medicare-for-all-but-states-eye-medicaid-buy-in/)at the state level \u2013 somewhat at odds with the Medicare for All proposals that have shaped at the national level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 4 Rural hospitals are hurting\n\n**In dire straits.**\n\nThere are 2,000 rural hospitals nationwide, and, according to [**new data**](https://www.navigant.com/news/corporate-news/2019/rural-hospitals-analysis), about 430 of those are considered at risk of closing/bankruptcy in 43 different [**states**](https://www.navigant.com/-/media/www/site/insights/healthcare/2019/navigant-rural-hospital-analysis-22019.pdf). For our math majors out here (thanks for following a healthcare newsletter) that\u2019s about a fifth of all rural hospitals, which is a pretty big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What next?**\n\nAccording to the study, 64% of these at-risk rural hospitals are considered highly essential to the health and economic well-being of their communities. The risk of closure is expected to increase if there\u2019s any sort of economic downturn, too. There are some options available for improvement, though! Some potential solutions include expanded access to tele-health, and further optimization of existing hospital operations in various areas (I won\u2019t bore you with the specifics).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 5 Earnings SZN\n\nLots of big healthcare companies released their full 2018 earnings reports and outlooks for 2019. Here are some major highlights from the week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo much growth\u2026yet coming up short on expectations was **Teladoc**. The company [**reported**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/information-technology/teladocs-visits-up-80-last-year-26-million)virtual visits growth of 80%, yet the stock sold off 10% after Teladoc issued soft expectations for 2019, which includes lower revenue growth and a steeper expected loss as the company focuses on strategic investments in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgainst all odds and a [**DOJ investigation**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/uhs-beats-expectations-amid-behavioral-health-doj-costs/549421/), **Universal Health Services** [**killed it**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/uhs-profit-plummets-fourth-quarter-stabilizes-full-year-results) last year. The co. had 2.6% same facility admissions growth to boot, but they had a tough fourth quarter \u2013 still, despite the strong disadvantages facing the company, the stock is up 5%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Amedisys** came in hot, [**announcing**](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/27/1743833/0/en/Amedisys-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Year-End-2018-Financial-Results-Issues-2019-Guidance.html) a strong 2018. Same-store admissions grew 4% in 2018. The stock is up 4% as of this writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LHC Group** fared just as well as its counterpart, Amedisys, in 2018. The company [**announced**](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/27/1743842/0/en/LHC-Group-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2018-Financial-Results.html)basically in-line revenue and EPS figures for the quarter, and expects a strong 2019 to boot. Stock is up 6% after the stellar print. They\u2019re also [**feeling pretty good**](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/02/lhc-group-bullish-on-home-health-jv-growth-after-strong-2018/) about their JV and M&A model. Well done, fam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tenet Healthcare** wowed investors too, [**delivering**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190225005997/en/Tenet-Reports-Results-Fourth-Quarter-Year-Ended) a strong year end performance. Same-facility net revenue grew 3.6% in 2018, and their outpatient (ambulatory) providers posted a strong year. The company\u2019s stock has [**popped**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tenet-healthcare-thc-q4-earnings-142902429.html) 16% since its earnings on Tuesday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, the **University of Pittsburgh Medical Center** saw its operating revenue [**grow**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/upmc-operating-revenue-up-20-to-19b-in-2018-as-it-preps-for-legal-bout/549511/) a whopping 20% \u2013 to $19 billion in 2018. Not bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\nRoche Group is [**DISHING it out**](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/25/1741192/0/en/Spark-Therapeutics-Enters-into-Definitive-Merger-Agreement-with-Roche.html) to buy **Spark Therapeutics** (seriously, they paid an over 100% premium), a gene therapy biotech company. **General Electric** [**sold**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/25/danaher-to-buy-the-general-electrics-bio-pharma-business-life-sciences-for-21point4-billion.html) its biopharma business to Danaher for a smooth $21.4 billion, and that probably means that an IPO for their healthcare business is [**off the table**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/25/ge-withdraws-plans-for-healthcare-ipo-after-danaher-deal-bloomberg.html) for now. Ever done an at-home DNA test? Congrats on knowing your family history! Oh, and the FBI [**probably has your DNA now**](https://www.axios.com/dna-test-results-privacy-genetic-data-sharing-4687b1a0-f527-425c-ac51-b5288b0c0293.html).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently physicians are [**worth**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/physicians-generate-2-4m-annually-for-their-hospitals-study-finds.html) $2.4 million each to their affiliated hospitals. Go ahead and [**welcome** ](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/02/lyft-continues-to-target-seniors-social-determinants-of-health-ahead-of-ipo/)**Uber** and **Lyft** to the healthcare industry! Maybe they\u2019ll help improve the [**wait and travel times**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/travel-to-healthcare-appointments-wait-times-havent-improved-in-11-years/549024/) for healthcare appointments, which apparently haven\u2019t improved in 11 years. That\u2019s one thing the smartphone can\u2019t do.

On average, heart bypass surgery costs $75,345 in the U.S., compared to $15,742 in the Netherlands, where the procedure is least expensive.\u201d\n\nI also found this picture on another part of the website: [https://imgur.com/a/ULU6j8F](https://imgur.com/a/ULU6j8F)\n\nMy question is are the prices given including or not including government subsidies? So, on average, a heart bypass costs only $15,742 in the Netherlands. Does that mean that even if someone in the Netherlands didn\u2019t have insurance (I know there\u2019s universal coverage in the Netherlands but I\u2019m trying to refer to a case where the government didn\u2019t offer any assistance), that the average bypass would only cost $15,742?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: How do I embed the picture?",

Are there any supplies where this is a chronic issue?\nI'm trying to do some research into the shortfalls of the healthcare system, especially when it comes to being short on various supplies at hospitals, doctor offices and emergency medical services (ambulance/fire-fighters/etc).\n\nOver the years I've read that healthcare workers find that they are in short supply of very basic items such as various IV solutions (saline bags being one that stands out, and now protective face masks).\n\nWhat I've heard is that there are very few manufacturer's of IV solutions, be they saline or glucose (not sure proper name), and often times manufacturer's tie the purchase of these necessities with the purchase of other drugs the company makes - meaning if you want 10,000 saline IV bags, you have to buy 5-10,000 bottles of a certain medication from the company (and sometimes the prices are either very low for the medication and high for the IV solutions, or vice-versa). So the healthcare providers are basically held hostage in buying these medications and in some reports it is said that these medications are not as effective as alternative medications used to treat the same condition - so the healthcare provider is stuck using these medications that aren't as effective (and often more expensive) as the alternatives on the market.  I've heard this story from at least 5-6 different sources so it seems like it might be common place, but I'd like to verify this.  If anyone has any insight into this, could you please corroborate or refute this, or give any additional details which might be helpful.\n\nOne example of these shortages of IV solutions was after Puerto Rico was hit by that major hurricane, and supposedly they were one of the major manufacturer's of these supplies along with other supplies and medications.\n\nI've also heard similar stories with companies only selling their premier drug if the company buys one/some of their other drugs that are, again, not as effective as alternatives on the market.  So providers are again stuck with inferior quality medications b/c they want to have the high quality medication the company sells.\n\nAre there any other supplies where providers are stuck in the same predicament?\n\nAre there any other situations that are similar to this?  Are there some supplies or drugs where providers find they are constantly having a difficult time procuring or the supplies/drugs are priced at outrageously high levels?\n\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to make saline solutions on-site, basically an empty bag that is filled with the proper water & salt/glucose mix?",

        "content": "Everything new in Healthcare this week - Coronavirus, Interoperability controversy, policy updates, and more. [News] [Discussion]\nHey everyone! Some pretty interesting stories this week. Most of the headline grabbers were about the coronavirus, but I thought the interoperability stuff was interesting as privacy continues to be a major issue for everyone in 2020.\n\n  \n\n**Everything you need to know about the Coronavirus.**\n\n* At this point, we're all aware of the Coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. Here's the latest updates:\n* While last week the number of infected was [**sitting at 650**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/china-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-634-as-singapore-confirms-first-infection.html) worldwide, the [**total reported cases**](https://apnews.com/74206108b920b6f2680844386ada3bdb) as of this writing is about 2,800. A majority of these infections occurred in Wuhan.\n* 40 total cases have been spotted outside of China - [**5 officially reported**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480001-cdc-confirms-fifth-coronavirus-case-in-us-out-of-arizona) within the U.S.\n* The markets [**sold off**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-slide-on-coronavirus-fears-11580119666?mod=hp_lead_pos1) Monday as fears spread about a potential epidemic. Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and McDonald's are suspending their operations during what is normally a higher level of consumer spending activity in China with Lunar New Year celebrations. [**Here's more info from Axios**](https://www.axios.com/world-worried-coronavirus-stocks-business-c62037ad-0c93-4aec-8b6e-7797c182f888.html) on the potential economic impact of the virus.\n* Officials have [**criticized China's response**](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-centralization-3ae5d7e7-1327-476e-93a9-6ea3e27db450.html) to the outbreak, blaming the regime's tendency for censorship while the virus spreads.\n* The virus is highly contagious and has a somewhat high mortality rate. Companies like J&J and Moderna are [**working on a vaccine**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/jj-pretty-confident-it-can-create-china-coronavirus-vaccine.html), but it could take up to a year to bring it to market.\n* With all of this news coverage, I can't help but think we're all just playing the popular video game Pandemic - which, ironically, saw a [**spike in sales**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/pandemic-video-game-plague-inc-surges-in-popularity-as-coronavirus-spreads-1.4783340) over the weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The latest trend: patients' access to their own health data.**\n\n* Epic, one of the largest electronic health record firms, is NOT at all a fan of HHS' recently proposed health data sharing rules (read about the [**proposed ruling here**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/industry-cheers-spirit-but-not-fine-print-in-hhs-interoperability-rules/556099/)). In an interesting development, Epic's CEO urged its health system partners in an e-mail to oppose the ruling. On Monday, Epic [**told Politico**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/epic-may-sue-hhs-over-interoperability-rules-concerns-judy-faulkner-says.html) that it may sue HHS over the ruling, calling it \"deeply flawed.\"\n* **Stuff about the ruling you should know**: The HHS proposed ruling is designed to provide clearer guidance on how patient health information can be accessed - namely, making it easier for patients to access their own health information. Epic thinks that the ruling will hurt patient privacy (since 3rd parties will have an easier time accessing that info) and wants to work with HHS to establish more appropriate guidelines. \n* **The bigger picture**: HHS' wants to make it easier for patients to access their data across health systems - something that Epic probably thinks is a key competitive advantage of theirs. Think about it. If all electronic health records systems - or other third parties - could easily access patient data regardless of the IT system any one provider is using, it becomes less important to have Epic - or any particular health records platform - as your system. \n* **Who's on board**: Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the Big Tech gang [**are on board with the interoperability proposal**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/apple-microsoft-joining-meeting-promoting-patient-access-to-data.html) and want the policy to go through so that consumers can access their data \"without further delay.\" Epic is definitely feeling the heat. They just [**announced the end of their collaboration**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/epic-systems-warns-customers-it-will-stop-supporting-google-cloud.html) with Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Blue Cross makes a play for generic drugs.**\n\n* Blue Cross Blue Shield wants you to know that it [**invested**](https://www.axios.com/blue-cross-blue-shield-civica-generic-drugs-70ebb81b-9fbb-4a30-8f89-13e42e20bbb4.html) in generic drug company Civica Rx this week to promote the development of generics in the market and cut prescription drug costs.\n* What is Civica Rx? It's a [**nonprofit partnership**](https://civicarx.org/about/) among health systems with the goal of combating drug shortages in hospitals\n* This initiative is growing ever important as generic drugmakers [**producing key drugs like antibiotics are struggling**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/25/health/antibiotics-new-resistance.html) financially.\n\n**Miscellaneous stuff.**\n\n* 2019 set a [**senior care M&A**](https://seniorcare.levinassociates.com/2020/01/17/2019-sets-senior-care-ma-record/) Record\n* Cardinal Health [**recalled 9 million hospital gowns**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-quality-issues-certain-cardinal-health-surgical-gowns-and-packs) this week.\n* What's going on with ADHD prescriptions? A [**study found**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/as-prescriptions-for-stimulants-to-treat-adhd-increased-so-did-pharma-payments-to-doctors) that as prescriptions for stimulants to treat ADHD increased, so did pharma payments to doctors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Digital Health Stories**\n\n**More about those medical records\u2026**\n\n* Google isn't the only Big Tech player getting involved in your medical records. Amazon, IBM, Microsoft also have access to [**millions of medical records through partnerships with health systems across the U.S**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/amazon-ibm-microsoft-have-access-to-millions-of-medical-records-wsj.html).\n* Health systems say that the partnerships, which originally were intended to include de-identified patient data, were not intended to mislead. Rather, once they got down the line, the system realized that it wasn't possible to separate the data that way. As designated business partners under HIPAA, these partnerships are legally permissible. Whether they're good for the consumer remains to be seen.\n* Read the originally reported article from the [**WSJ here**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200).\n\n**SmileDirectClub is in the news again\u2026keep your mouth shut.** \n\n* Before issuing refunds to customers, SmileDirectClub is [**forcing them to sign NDAs**](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077146/smile-direct-club-nda-bad-reviews-online-teeth-aligner-customer-refunds), which prevents those customers from submitting bad reviews of SDC's products online.

They'll look for additional streams of revenue and ways to monetize their immense DNA dataset.\n\n**Uber Health** plans to [**double in size**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/uber-health-plans-to-double-in-size-this-year/570771/) this year and is going on a hiring spree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Election 2020**\n\n* From the WSJ - healthcare stocks [**tend to underperform**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-and-tech-stocks-tend-to-underperform-in-election-years-11579611600) during election years. It makes sense. Investors get skittish as new government enters the various branches of government, and healthcare is one of the highest regulated industries around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Policy Corner**\n\n**A microscope over hospital mergers.**\n\n* The FTC is planning to [**scrutinize hospital mergers**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ftc-commissioner-pledges-hard-line-on-hospital-mergers/570634/) much closer in 2020 and beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme Court's healthcare flurry.**\n\n* The Supreme Court will [**review religious exemptions**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/supreme-court-review-religious-exemptions-aca-birth-control-coverage) to ACA birth control coverage.\n* The high court also decided last week that it [**won't fast track the ongoing ACA case**](https://www.axios.com/affordable-care-act-supreme-court-2020-election-27c3b536-8d0f-4ae5-a0cc-34d69edef43a.html).

I've tried doing some searching but keep getting directed to info about unemployment insurance. \n\nThanks!!",

The biggest thing you will want to look for is are you able to get cobra or pay cash for those monthly weigh check ins (insurance will make you start over if you miss a month/they are not consecutive). Next make sure you are clarifying what the requirements are for new insurance. The requirements are so different for each insurance and you will want to look into that so you can know what you are getting into (some want 12 months monthly check ins, some will require support groups or exercise consult).\n\n(Source: I work in a bariatrics office)",

Even a big corporation like IBM may have to close a division if 5-10% of their staff goes on leave and the cost and risk of training temps is too much (I've definitely read about this happening to people).\n\nAs far as this person's claim, I'll make an unpopular comment : You have literally no idea if this is legit claim worthy of sympathy or not. I've seen people ask for disability accommodations for orthopedic complaints asking to be forgiven for being late daily to their call center jobs, things like that. I would definitely not be so quick to take sides based on a comment on the internet. Why bring it up? How does it relate to reviewing over-sized rubber bands?",

        "content": "Healthcare's 5 Biggest Stories, Week of April Fools - Trump goes for the Obamacare Jugular, Centene buys WellCare, New York bans Unvaccinated Children, and more. [News]\nHey everyone! Back again this week with the top healthcare stories. As always, let me know if you think I missed anything big:\n\n# 1 New York Suburb Bans Unvaccinated Children from the Public\n\n**That seems drastic.**\n\nThis week, Rockland County, a suburb of New York, declared a [**state of emergency**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html) based on the rampant [**measles outbreak**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/measles-outbreak-jews-nyc.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) facing their county's population. The first step? Banning all unvaccinated children and teenagers from public places. This type of action is pretty unprecedented, but so is getting the measles. Although the measles vaccine is about 97% effective, only 72% of the Rockland adolescent population is vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. The ban comes at a time when measles cases through the first 3 months of the year [**have already outpaced**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/us-measles-cases-surpass-2018-totals-as-outbreaks-spread.html) last year's total reported cases altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2 PBMs going to testify before Congress Wednesday 4/3\n\n**This week's hottest TV.**\n\nTune in to the Senate finance committee hearing this Wednesday to see some absolutely heart-pounding, riveting, must-see TV. Last month in our [**March 4th edition**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-3-4-2019/), we covered lawmakers inviting drugmakers to Capitol Hill to ask why drug costs were so high. Those companies placed 100% of the blame onto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are basically the middlemen between the makers and the patients. Now, the Senate wants to [**ask PBMs some questions**](https://www.axios.com/cvs-trump-drug-pricing-rebate-plan-51bd0100-9be3-4bd7-804a-da9948057533.html) about their drug rebate practices and whether they're ACTUALLY saving patients money on drugs. Companies like CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna are preparing to get grilled come Wednesday, especially as Congress prepares potential legislation around [**abolishing drug rebate practices for good**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/squeeze-looks-more-likely-for-drug-middlemen-11553530346) (paywall).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3 Trump goes for the jugular on Obamacare\n\n**Fuel to the political fire.**\n\nAs if declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional weren't enough, the Trump administration has now declared its intent to [**completely repeal and replace the ACA**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/436153-gop-senators-blindsided-by-trump-on-obamacare)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remind me - what's going on right now?**\n\nIn 2018, the tax bill repealed the ACA's individual mandate, meaning that people who opted not to have health insurance would not longer be penalized for doing so. After this happened, several states took the ACA to court in Texas late in December of last year. In that hearing, a judge [**ruled against the ACA**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/the-affordable-care-act-ruled-unconstitutional-by-tx-federal-judge.html), declaring the entire bill unconsitutional now that the individual mandate wasn't a thing. Of course, the ruling was appealed and is still tied up in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supreme Court Inbound.**\n\nWith heated debates surrounding healthcare on both sides of the aisle, it seems as if a Supreme Court showdown is almost inevitable. Trump thinks he's in good standing considering the currently conservative lean of the bench. But that raises the question - if the lawsuit against the ACA is successful, [**what comes next for healthcare**](https://www.axios.com/justice-trump-court-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-ab8bf281-65fc-4b91-8606-d1f3f65818d6.html)? Because it doesn't look like there's any proposed system to take the ACA's place. The debate around healthcare will only intensify as the administration turns up the heat and 2020 approaches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Centene buys WellCare in $17 billion deal\n\n**A Medicaid Giant.**\n\nCentene [**secured**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centene-17b-wellcare-buy-will-boost-medicare-footprint/551411/) plans this week to purchase its main competitor, WellCare, in a $17.3 billion deal (a 32% premium to their share price). The merger comes at a time when mega-sized healthcare firms are joining forces pretty frequently (think CVS / Aetna, Cigna / Express Scripts, and a whole host of others). What's different about these firms, though, is that they've made their killing mainly by managing Medicaid programs for states. Their businesses really took off under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed for expansion of Medicaid, and thus, the expansion of Centene's and WellCare's businesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not so fast.**\n\nBecause this transaction is a huge 'horizontal' merger in a highly regulated area, this deal is highly likely to raise antitrust concerns. Also, as we just covered above, any existential threat to the ACA would probably REALLY hamstring any further growth available to the new company. If the deal does go through, look for these companies to leverage their size and aggressively target the Medicare Advantage market. Like we talked about in our [**February 11th 3rd story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-2-8-2019/), Medicare Advantage is growing like a weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 UPS Enters the Home Care Market\n\n**Robots and Drones.**\n\nAs a part of UPS' push into autonomous technology, the parcel giant is partnering with the drone company Matternet to [**deliver lab samples**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ups-teams-up-with-drone-startup-to-deliver-medical-samples-at-north-carolin/551487/) in North Carolina. The pilot program is part of a larger push from UPS into diversifying its revenue streams and changing home delivery as a whole. The approach is pretty innovative. If successful, the program could help seniors receive better and quicker care, all while pushing the lab industry toward an on-demand future (sound familiar, Theranos?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\nKeep on the look out for Johnson & Johnson's new drug ad, which will [**disclose**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-to-air-first-tv-ad-for-drug-that-discloses-its-price-11553786572) the cost of a drug for the first time on TV. Following last week's story on the FDA's [**secret medical device database**](https://khn.org/news/hidden-fda-database-medical-device-injuries-malfunctions/), watchdog groups are now [**calling**](https://khn.org/news/device-safety-experts-to-fda-make-data-public/) on the FDA to make all device data public.

        "content": "[Discussion] No Child Without Vaccination, No Family Without Health Insurance: The Political Economy of Public Health in Rwanda\n In just 100 days, almost one million Tutsis, moderate Hutu and Twa were massacred in one of the most brutal episodes of violence n modern history. Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country.\n\nPart of gaining legitimacy to govern is stamping out petty corruption in the bureaucracy. To government regularly takes action such as firing hundreds of [police officers](https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/rwanda-fires-200-police-officers-accused-of-corruption-20170206), or entire departments of the [ministry of health](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Rwanda-fires-health-directors-disbands-medical-tech-unit/4552908-4707022-voekylz/index.html) suspected of corruption and as a result Transparency International's Corruption Index ranks Rwanda the least corrupt Least Developed Country in the world. Moreover, the government has worked assiduously with donors to adapt best practices on institutional design to local circumstances. An example of this is the Imihigo system of to a management. Imihigo refers to a precolonial system where warriors would publicly pledge what they would accomplish in battle, and face humiliation if they failed to achieve those goals. In its modern adaptation, mayors and other higher level officials would pledge to accomplish development goals, and assisted by a large core of elected local leaders in achieving those goals. While the goals were set by the central government, elected leaders have high levels of authority in how goals are to implemented allowing for best practices to spread from district to district.\n\nOne of the greatest successes of the efficient and flexible state is improving public health outcomes in Rwanda. Rwanda today has a life expectancy of 67 and an infant mortality rate of 29, levels of health outcomes similar to much wealthier nations such as India or Bolivia. Part of this success stems from the over 45,000 elected community health workers at the village level. They are generally respected members of the community and tasked with ensuring universal vaccination, and to serve as the first line of healthcare. In order to improve health in a systematic manner, the government has implemented a health insurance system that covers over 90% of the population. The bottom quarter of the population does not have to pay into the system, and even the top .5% of Rwandans only have to pay $9 a month. However, given most Rwandans hover above basic subsistence, it has taken the coercive might of the Rwandan state to make this system financially feasible.\n\n# Suggested Reading\n\n[The politics of state effectiveness in Burundi and\u00a0**Rwanda**: ruling elite legitimacy and the imperative of state performance](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3353/), Benjamin Chemouni\n\n[PERFOMANCE CONTRACTS\u00a0AND SOCIAL SERVICE DELIVERY- LESSONS FROM RWANDA](https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/Policy_Brief_-_Perfomance_Contracts_and_Social_Service_Delivery_-_Lessons_from_Rwanda.pdf) , African Development Bank\n\n[Near universal childhood vaccination rates in Rwanda: how was this achieved and can it be duplicated?](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30176-1/fulltext) , James Bao\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda\\_-\\_economic\\_miracle.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda_-_economic_miracle.mp3)",

COB is a CON. \n\nAmerican families are wasting so much money by having 2 insurers. I feel this is the biggest ripoff in  healthcare right now and more people need to be educated that having multiple insurance plans does not benefit  them at all. \n\nAmericans are paying hundreds of dollars a month in premiums for secondary coverage that pays pennies on the dollar If anything at all on claims they receive. COB ties up more administrative costs to billing offices and insurance plans than they are worth to patients. Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? People think a secondary insurance will make it so they have no out of pocket costs when going to the doctor, but they are badly misinformed. If the primary insurance has better benefits than the secondary insurance the secondary plan pays NOTHING. People are unknowingly lighting these premiums on fire for a useless plan. \n\nExample as follows: \nPrimary insurance: $15 Co-pay for office visit. \nSecondary Insurance $20 Co-Pay for office visit. When secondary receives the claim they will not pay anything!\n\nPrimary insurance $30 Co-pay\nSecondary Insurance $15 Co-Pay. \nSecondary will only pay $15 on the claim to give patient $15 dollar liability. \n\nWhat is the point of paying premiums for both plans??? Just pick the best one and cancel the other one!!! \n\nSorry for my rant, but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient? This is the biggest scam in America right now and people need to be educated in order to make the best financial decisions for their family. \n\nThis rant is for Commercial plans. Medicare supplemental plans and Medicare Advantage plans are great. \n ",

                "content": ">but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the time, every day.  I work processing insurance for people who come into the ER for 3 hospitals.  If they don't have two insurances they tend to pay through the nose depending on what it is.  But believe me, for the most part, having two insurances saves people quite a lot.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can argue that it's the ER.  Usually the same person wont go there every day right?  Well there are some really unhealthy people.  And yeah, we see them once a month at least.\n\n\n\n\nSure it depends on the plan too.  Some people have really good plans and having a secondary wouldn't be useful.  But those people on bad plans?  I see charges up to 7K regularly for those with no secondary.  Yeah, that's right.  Their insurance plan has a 7K deductible.  \n\n\n\n\n\n>Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? \n\n\n\n\n\nDon't know where you're getting that from.  I haven't experienced that at all.  But hey I don't know absolutely everything so maybe there's something on the billing end I don't see.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would hesitate to say it's always a rip off.  I've seen way too many situations vary wildly from one person to the next.  Some people, sure, it doesn't work for them.  And they should be educated about it (for instance, dual insurance is actually SUPER good for me due to health issues, but not my husband.  So he's not on my insurance).  But there are just as many people who need it.  You can't pretend everyone's health situation is the same.  It isn't.  Charges vary wildly.  State laws even vary wildly.  I don't think this is a good thing to blanket statement.",

This is a real life scenario many of us have experienced (if you're some sort of health care provider) and this may be interesting to those who are not. The key question at the end of it all is, \"Why are corporations not held to the same responsibilities and values?\"\n\nYou're at an orientation meeting. The CEO, the CMO, the folks from HR and the CIO (and whoever else in the C-suite alphabet soup who wants to seems like they care) are all enthused you're joining the team, but before you get on your feet and be a productive member at this \"state of the art facility\" that \"puts patients first\" they need to you give you their recycled powerpoint lectures. Somewhere within in the middle, or scattered throughout, they're re-telling the story of PIH. I agree. It's important and we should all take it seriously. But let's dissect the nuance of the severely understated double standard.\n\nFor example, a nurse or a physician can't look up the PIH of his/her child. If you do-you're fired or strictly disciplined in some way. You've done something horribly wrong. You're breaking the rules. You're not compassionate about other patient's privacy. You don't care. You're not a good person. How dare you?Unless- you've signed a release for your own child's PHI (in advance) to give *\\_yourself\\_* permission to browse the chart. False alarm, turn off the sirens, it's all okay. The paperwork checks out....\n\nThe lecturer continues to acknowledge the \"*unavoidable*\" circumstances and \"**incidentals**\" as I heard one administrator call it. The patient room that houses two patients. Or the uncontrollably \"packed\" ER. Other patient's in these environments overhear your discussions with the neighboring patient and can learn about his/her illness, and anything about his/her care that is audibly enunciated. But that's okay. It's incidental. We can't avoid that. So try your best to whisper. In this case it's not that serious as we (the corporation) made it out to be compared to when it was your fault. It's our (the corporation) fault now so we'll just call it incidental.\n\nSorry. This is ***not*** right. This is not fair. As a corporation why don't you spend more money and build more rooms. Make all rooms private. Make larger ERs. Instead of \"packing\" the house and creating these so-called \"incidentals.\"\n\nThe amount of control on our lives is ridiculous. Fire me for something the corporations are doing without ownership (no pun intended), but at the same time, function as our moderators and disciplinary authorities.\n\nDouble standard.",

        "content": "[Discussion] Supplies and/or drugs often in short supply in the industry or things that are priced ridiculously high. Are there any supplies where this is a chronic issue?\nI'm trying to do some research into the shortfalls of the healthcare system, especially when it comes to being short on various supplies at hospitals, doctor offices and emergency medical services (ambulance/fire-fighters/etc).\n\nOver the years I've read that healthcare workers find that they are in short supply of very basic items such as various IV solutions (saline bags being one that stands out, and now protective face masks).\n\nWhat I've heard is that there are very few manufacturer's of IV solutions, be they saline or glucose (not sure proper name), and often times manufacturer's tie the purchase of these necessities with the purchase of other drugs the company makes - meaning if you want 10,000 saline IV bags, you have to buy 5-10,000 bottles of a certain medication from the company (and sometimes the prices are either very low for the medication and high for the IV solutions, or vice-versa). So the healthcare providers are basically held hostage in buying these medications and in some reports it is said that these medications are not as effective as alternative medications used to treat the same condition - so the healthcare provider is stuck using these medications that aren't as effective (and often more expensive) as the alternatives on the market.  I've heard this story from at least 5-6 different sources so it seems like it might be common place, but I'd like to verify this.  If anyone has any insight into this, could you please corroborate or refute this, or give any additional details which might be helpful.\n\nOne example of these shortages of IV solutions was after Puerto Rico was hit by that major hurricane, and supposedly they were one of the major manufacturer's of these supplies along with other supplies and medications.\n\nI've also heard similar stories with companies only selling their premier drug if the company buys one/some of their other drugs that are, again, not as effective as alternatives on the market.  So providers are again stuck with inferior quality medications b/c they want to have the high quality medication the company sells.\n\nAre there any other supplies where providers are stuck in the same predicament?\n\nAre there any other situations that are similar to this?  Are there some supplies or drugs where providers find they are constantly having a difficult time procuring or the supplies/drugs are priced at outrageously high levels?\n\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to make saline solutions on-site, basically an empty bag that is filled with the proper water & salt/glucose mix?",

        "content": "Everything new in Healthcare this week - Coronavirus, Interoperability controversy, policy updates, and more. [News] [Discussion]\nHey everyone! Some pretty interesting stories this week. Most of the headline grabbers were about the coronavirus, but I thought the interoperability stuff was interesting as privacy continues to be a major issue for everyone in 2020.\n\n  \n\n**Everything you need to know about the Coronavirus.**\n\n* At this point, we're all aware of the Coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. Here's the latest updates:\n* While last week the number of infected was [**sitting at 650**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/china-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-634-as-singapore-confirms-first-infection.html) worldwide, the [**total reported cases**](https://apnews.com/74206108b920b6f2680844386ada3bdb) as of this writing is about 2,800. A majority of these infections occurred in Wuhan.\n* 40 total cases have been spotted outside of China - [**5 officially reported**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480001-cdc-confirms-fifth-coronavirus-case-in-us-out-of-arizona) within the U.S.\n* The markets [**sold off**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-slide-on-coronavirus-fears-11580119666?mod=hp_lead_pos1) Monday as fears spread about a potential epidemic. Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and McDonald's are suspending their operations during what is normally a higher level of consumer spending activity in China with Lunar New Year celebrations. [**Here's more info from Axios**](https://www.axios.com/world-worried-coronavirus-stocks-business-c62037ad-0c93-4aec-8b6e-7797c182f888.html) on the potential economic impact of the virus.\n* Officials have [**criticized China's response**](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-centralization-3ae5d7e7-1327-476e-93a9-6ea3e27db450.html) to the outbreak, blaming the regime's tendency for censorship while the virus spreads.\n* The virus is highly contagious and has a somewhat high mortality rate. Companies like J&J and Moderna are [**working on a vaccine**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/jj-pretty-confident-it-can-create-china-coronavirus-vaccine.html), but it could take up to a year to bring it to market.\n* With all of this news coverage, I can't help but think we're all just playing the popular video game Pandemic - which, ironically, saw a [**spike in sales**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/pandemic-video-game-plague-inc-surges-in-popularity-as-coronavirus-spreads-1.4783340) over the weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The latest trend: patients' access to their own health data.**\n\n* Epic, one of the largest electronic health record firms, is NOT at all a fan of HHS' recently proposed health data sharing rules (read about the [**proposed ruling here**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/industry-cheers-spirit-but-not-fine-print-in-hhs-interoperability-rules/556099/)). In an interesting development, Epic's CEO urged its health system partners in an e-mail to oppose the ruling. On Monday, Epic [**told Politico**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/epic-may-sue-hhs-over-interoperability-rules-concerns-judy-faulkner-says.html) that it may sue HHS over the ruling, calling it \"deeply flawed.\"\n* **Stuff about the ruling you should know**: The HHS proposed ruling is designed to provide clearer guidance on how patient health information can be accessed - namely, making it easier for patients to access their own health information. Epic thinks that the ruling will hurt patient privacy (since 3rd parties will have an easier time accessing that info) and wants to work with HHS to establish more appropriate guidelines. \n* **The bigger picture**: HHS' wants to make it easier for patients to access their data across health systems - something that Epic probably thinks is a key competitive advantage of theirs. Think about it. If all electronic health records systems - or other third parties - could easily access patient data regardless of the IT system any one provider is using, it becomes less important to have Epic - or any particular health records platform - as your system. \n* **Who's on board**: Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the Big Tech gang [**are on board with the interoperability proposal**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/apple-microsoft-joining-meeting-promoting-patient-access-to-data.html) and want the policy to go through so that consumers can access their data \"without further delay.\" Epic is definitely feeling the heat.

Rather, once they got down the line, the system realized that it wasn't possible to separate the data that way. As designated business partners under HIPAA, these partnerships are legally permissible. Whether they're good for the consumer remains to be seen.\n* Read the originally reported article from the [**WSJ here**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200).\n\n**SmileDirectClub is in the news again\u2026keep your mouth shut.** \n\n* Before issuing refunds to customers, SmileDirectClub is [**forcing them to sign NDAs**](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077146/smile-direct-club-nda-bad-reviews-online-teeth-aligner-customer-refunds), which prevents those customers from submitting bad reviews of SDC's products online.

It has limitations, one of which is if the business has less than 50 employees ( could have the number wrong ). It makes sense to have some limitations, if you start a business and have one employee that goes on leave you may not have to pay them but you have to employ a temp to do their job as they may choose to return -- not always feasible, that could bankrupt a business. Even a big corporation like IBM may have to close a division if 5-10% of their staff goes on leave and the cost and risk of training temps is too much (I've definitely read about this happening to people).\n\nAs far as this person's claim, I'll make an unpopular comment : You have literally no idea if this is legit claim worthy of sympathy or not. I've seen people ask for disability accommodations for orthopedic complaints asking to be forgiven for being late daily to their call center jobs, things like that. I would definitely not be so quick to take sides based on a comment on the internet. Why bring it up? How does it relate to reviewing over-sized rubber bands?",

        "content": "Healthcare's 5 Biggest Stories, Week of April Fools - Trump goes for the Obamacare Jugular, Centene buys WellCare, New York bans Unvaccinated Children, and more. [News]\nHey everyone! Back again this week with the top healthcare stories. As always, let me know if you think I missed anything big:\n\n# 1 New York Suburb Bans Unvaccinated Children from the Public\n\n**That seems drastic.**\n\nThis week, Rockland County, a suburb of New York, declared a [**state of emergency**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html) based on the rampant [**measles outbreak**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/measles-outbreak-jews-nyc.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) facing their county's population. The first step? Banning all unvaccinated children and teenagers from public places. This type of action is pretty unprecedented, but so is getting the measles. Although the measles vaccine is about 97% effective, only 72% of the Rockland adolescent population is vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. The ban comes at a time when measles cases through the first 3 months of the year [**have already outpaced**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/us-measles-cases-surpass-2018-totals-as-outbreaks-spread.html) last year's total reported cases altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2 PBMs going to testify before Congress Wednesday 4/3\n\n**This week's hottest TV.**\n\nTune in to the Senate finance committee hearing this Wednesday to see some absolutely heart-pounding, riveting, must-see TV. Last month in our [**March 4th edition**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-3-4-2019/), we covered lawmakers inviting drugmakers to Capitol Hill to ask why drug costs were so high. Those companies placed 100% of the blame onto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are basically the middlemen between the makers and the patients. Now, the Senate wants to [**ask PBMs some questions**](https://www.axios.com/cvs-trump-drug-pricing-rebate-plan-51bd0100-9be3-4bd7-804a-da9948057533.html) about their drug rebate practices and whether they're ACTUALLY saving patients money on drugs. Companies like CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna are preparing to get grilled come Wednesday, especially as Congress prepares potential legislation around [**abolishing drug rebate practices for good**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/squeeze-looks-more-likely-for-drug-middlemen-11553530346) (paywall).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3 Trump goes for the jugular on Obamacare\n\n**Fuel to the political fire.**\n\nAs if declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional weren't enough, the Trump administration has now declared its intent to [**completely repeal and replace the ACA**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/436153-gop-senators-blindsided-by-trump-on-obamacare)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remind me - what's going on right now?**\n\nIn 2018, the tax bill repealed the ACA's individual mandate, meaning that people who opted not to have health insurance would not longer be penalized for doing so. After this happened, several states took the ACA to court in Texas late in December of last year. In that hearing, a judge [**ruled against the ACA**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/the-affordable-care-act-ruled-unconstitutional-by-tx-federal-judge.html), declaring the entire bill unconsitutional now that the individual mandate wasn't a thing. Of course, the ruling was appealed and is still tied up in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supreme Court Inbound.**\n\nWith heated debates surrounding healthcare on both sides of the aisle, it seems as if a Supreme Court showdown is almost inevitable. Trump thinks he's in good standing considering the currently conservative lean of the bench. But that raises the question - if the lawsuit against the ACA is successful, [**what comes next for healthcare**](https://www.axios.com/justice-trump-court-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-ab8bf281-65fc-4b91-8606-d1f3f65818d6.html)? Because it doesn't look like there's any proposed system to take the ACA's place. The debate around healthcare will only intensify as the administration turns up the heat and 2020 approaches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Centene buys WellCare in $17 billion deal\n\n**A Medicaid Giant.**\n\nCentene [**secured**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centene-17b-wellcare-buy-will-boost-medicare-footprint/551411/) plans this week to purchase its main competitor, WellCare, in a $17.3 billion deal (a 32% premium to their share price). The merger comes at a time when mega-sized healthcare firms are joining forces pretty frequently (think CVS / Aetna, Cigna / Express Scripts, and a whole host of others). What's different about these firms, though, is that they've made their killing mainly by managing Medicaid programs for states. Their businesses really took off under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed for expansion of Medicaid, and thus, the expansion of Centene's and WellCare's businesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not so fast.**\n\nBecause this transaction is a huge 'horizontal' merger in a highly regulated area, this deal is highly likely to raise antitrust concerns. Also, as we just covered above, any existential threat to the ACA would probably REALLY hamstring any further growth available to the new company. If the deal does go through, look for these companies to leverage their size and aggressively target the Medicare Advantage market. Like we talked about in our [**February 11th 3rd story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-2-8-2019/), Medicare Advantage is growing like a weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 UPS Enters the Home Care Market\n\n**Robots and Drones.**\n\nAs a part of UPS' push into autonomous technology, the parcel giant is partnering with the drone company Matternet to [**deliver lab samples**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ups-teams-up-with-drone-startup-to-deliver-medical-samples-at-north-carolin/551487/) in North Carolina. The pilot program is part of a larger push from UPS into diversifying its revenue streams and changing home delivery as a whole. The approach is pretty innovative. If successful, the program could help seniors receive better and quicker care, all while pushing the lab industry toward an on-demand future (sound familiar, Theranos?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\nKeep on the look out for Johnson & Johnson's new drug ad, which will [**disclose**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-to-air-first-tv-ad-for-drug-that-discloses-its-price-11553786572) the cost of a drug for the first time on TV. Following last week's story on the FDA's [**secret medical device database**](https://khn.org/news/hidden-fda-database-medical-device-injuries-malfunctions/), watchdog groups are now [**calling**](https://khn.org/news/device-safety-experts-to-fda-make-data-public/) on the FDA to make all device data public.

        "content": "[Discussion] No Child Without Vaccination, No Family Without Health Insurance: The Political Economy of Public Health in Rwanda\n In just 100 days, almost one million Tutsis, moderate Hutu and Twa were massacred in one of the most brutal episodes of violence n modern history. Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country.\n\nPart of gaining legitimacy to govern is stamping out petty corruption in the bureaucracy. To government regularly takes action such as firing hundreds of [police officers](https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/rwanda-fires-200-police-officers-accused-of-corruption-20170206), or entire departments of the [ministry of health](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Rwanda-fires-health-directors-disbands-medical-tech-unit/4552908-4707022-voekylz/index.html) suspected of corruption and as a result Transparency International's Corruption Index ranks Rwanda the least corrupt Least Developed Country in the world. Moreover, the government has worked assiduously with donors to adapt best practices on institutional design to local circumstances. An example of this is the Imihigo system of to a management. Imihigo refers to a precolonial system where warriors would publicly pledge what they would accomplish in battle, and face humiliation if they failed to achieve those goals. In its modern adaptation, mayors and other higher level officials would pledge to accomplish development goals, and assisted by a large core of elected local leaders in achieving those goals. While the goals were set by the central government, elected leaders have high levels of authority in how goals are to implemented allowing for best practices to spread from district to district.\n\nOne of the greatest successes of the efficient and flexible state is improving public health outcomes in Rwanda. Rwanda today has a life expectancy of 67 and an infant mortality rate of 29, levels of health outcomes similar to much wealthier nations such as India or Bolivia. Part of this success stems from the over 45,000 elected community health workers at the village level. They are generally respected members of the community and tasked with ensuring universal vaccination, and to serve as the first line of healthcare. In order to improve health in a systematic manner, the government has implemented a health insurance system that covers over 90% of the population. The bottom quarter of the population does not have to pay into the system, and even the top .5% of Rwandans only have to pay $9 a month. However, given most Rwandans hover above basic subsistence, it has taken the coercive might of the Rwandan state to make this system financially feasible.\n\n# Suggested Reading\n\n[The politics of state effectiveness in Burundi and\u00a0**Rwanda**: ruling elite legitimacy and the imperative of state performance](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3353/), Benjamin Chemouni\n\n[PERFOMANCE CONTRACTS\u00a0AND SOCIAL SERVICE DELIVERY- LESSONS FROM RWANDA](https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/Policy_Brief_-_Perfomance_Contracts_and_Social_Service_Delivery_-_Lessons_from_Rwanda.pdf) , African Development Bank\n\n[Near universal childhood vaccination rates in Rwanda: how was this achieved and can it be duplicated?](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30176-1/fulltext) , James Bao\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda\\_-\\_economic\\_miracle.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda_-_economic_miracle.mp3)",

COB is a CON. \n\nAmerican families are wasting so much money by having 2 insurers. I feel this is the biggest ripoff in  healthcare right now and more people need to be educated that having multiple insurance plans does not benefit  them at all. \n\nAmericans are paying hundreds of dollars a month in premiums for secondary coverage that pays pennies on the dollar If anything at all on claims they receive. COB ties up more administrative costs to billing offices and insurance plans than they are worth to patients. Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? People think a secondary insurance will make it so they have no out of pocket costs when going to the doctor, but they are badly misinformed. If the primary insurance has better benefits than the secondary insurance the secondary plan pays NOTHING. People are unknowingly lighting these premiums on fire for a useless plan. \n\nExample as follows: \nPrimary insurance: $15 Co-pay for office visit. \nSecondary Insurance $20 Co-Pay for office visit. When secondary receives the claim they will not pay anything!\n\nPrimary insurance $30 Co-pay\nSecondary Insurance $15 Co-Pay. \nSecondary will only pay $15 on the claim to give patient $15 dollar liability. \n\nWhat is the point of paying premiums for both plans??? Just pick the best one and cancel the other one!!! \n\nSorry for my rant, but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient? This is the biggest scam in America right now and people need to be educated in order to make the best financial decisions for their family. \n\nThis rant is for Commercial plans. Medicare supplemental plans and Medicare Advantage plans are great. \n ",

                "content": ">but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the time, every day.  I work processing insurance for people who come into the ER for 3 hospitals.  If they don't have two insurances they tend to pay through the nose depending on what it is.  But believe me, for the most part, having two insurances saves people quite a lot.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can argue that it's the ER.  Usually the same person wont go there every day right?  Well there are some really unhealthy people.  And yeah, we see them once a month at least.\n\n\n\n\nSure it depends on the plan too.  Some people have really good plans and having a secondary wouldn't be useful.  But those people on bad plans?  I see charges up to 7K regularly for those with no secondary.  Yeah, that's right.  Their insurance plan has a 7K deductible.  \n\n\n\n\n\n>Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? \n\n\n\n\n\nDon't know where you're getting that from.  I haven't experienced that at all.  But hey I don't know absolutely everything so maybe there's something on the billing end I don't see.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would hesitate to say it's always a rip off.  I've seen way too many situations vary wildly from one person to the next.  Some people, sure, it doesn't work for them.  And they should be educated about it (for instance, dual insurance is actually SUPER good for me due to health issues, but not my husband.  So he's not on my insurance).  But there are just as many people who need it.  You can't pretend everyone's health situation is the same.  It isn't.  Charges vary wildly.  State laws even vary wildly.  I don't think this is a good thing to blanket statement.",

This is a real life scenario many of us have experienced (if you're some sort of health care provider) and this may be interesting to those who are not. The key question at the end of it all is, \"Why are corporations not held to the same responsibilities and values?\"\n\nYou're at an orientation meeting. The CEO, the CMO, the folks from HR and the CIO (and whoever else in the C-suite alphabet soup who wants to seems like they care) are all enthused you're joining the team, but before you get on your feet and be a productive member at this \"state of the art facility\" that \"puts patients first\" they need to you give you their recycled powerpoint lectures. Somewhere within in the middle, or scattered throughout, they're re-telling the story of PIH. I agree. It's important and we should all take it seriously. But let's dissect the nuance of the severely understated double standard.\n\nFor example, a nurse or a physician can't look up the PIH of his/her child. If you do-you're fired or strictly disciplined in some way. You've done something horribly wrong. You're breaking the rules. You're not compassionate about other patient's privacy. You don't care. You're not a good person. How dare you?Unless- you've signed a release for your own child's PHI (in advance) to give *\\_yourself\\_* permission to browse the chart. False alarm, turn off the sirens, it's all okay. The paperwork checks out....\n\nThe lecturer continues to acknowledge the \"*unavoidable*\" circumstances and \"**incidentals**\" as I heard one administrator call it. The patient room that houses two patients. Or the uncontrollably \"packed\" ER. Other patient's in these environments overhear your discussions with the neighboring patient and can learn about his/her illness, and anything about his/her care that is audibly enunciated. But that's okay. It's incidental. We can't avoid that. So try your best to whisper. In this case it's not that serious as we (the corporation) made it out to be compared to when it was your fault. It's our (the corporation) fault now so we'll just call it incidental.\n\nSorry. This is ***not*** right. This is not fair. As a corporation why don't you spend more money and build more rooms. Make all rooms private. Make larger ERs. Instead of \"packing\" the house and creating these so-called \"incidentals.\"\n\nThe amount of control on our lives is ridiculous. Fire me for something the corporations are doing without ownership (no pun intended), but at the same time, function as our moderators and disciplinary authorities.\n\nDouble standard.",

        "content": "[Discussion] Supplies and/or drugs often in short supply in the industry or things that are priced ridiculously high. Are there any supplies where this is a chronic issue?\nI'm trying to do some research into the shortfalls of the healthcare system, especially when it comes to being short on various supplies at hospitals, doctor offices and emergency medical services (ambulance/fire-fighters/etc).\n\nOver the years I've read that healthcare workers find that they are in short supply of very basic items such as various IV solutions (saline bags being one that stands out, and now protective face masks).\n\nWhat I've heard is that there are very few manufacturer's of IV solutions, be they saline or glucose (not sure proper name), and often times manufacturer's tie the purchase of these necessities with the purchase of other drugs the company makes - meaning if you want 10,000 saline IV bags, you have to buy 5-10,000 bottles of a certain medication from the company (and sometimes the prices are either very low for the medication and high for the IV solutions, or vice-versa). So the healthcare providers are basically held hostage in buying these medications and in some reports it is said that these medications are not as effective as alternative medications used to treat the same condition - so the healthcare provider is stuck using these medications that aren't as effective (and often more expensive) as the alternatives on the market.  I've heard this story from at least 5-6 different sources so it seems like it might be common place, but I'd like to verify this.  If anyone has any insight into this, could you please corroborate or refute this, or give any additional details which might be helpful.\n\nOne example of these shortages of IV solutions was after Puerto Rico was hit by that major hurricane, and supposedly they were one of the major manufacturer's of these supplies along with other supplies and medications.\n\nI've also heard similar stories with companies only selling their premier drug if the company buys one/some of their other drugs that are, again, not as effective as alternatives on the market.  So providers are again stuck with inferior quality medications b/c they want to have the high quality medication the company sells.\n\nAre there any other supplies where providers are stuck in the same predicament?\n\nAre there any other situations that are similar to this?  Are there some supplies or drugs where providers find they are constantly having a difficult time procuring or the supplies/drugs are priced at outrageously high levels?\n\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to make saline solutions on-site, basically an empty bag that is filled with the proper water & salt/glucose mix?",

        "content": "Everything new in Healthcare this week - Coronavirus, Interoperability controversy, policy updates, and more. [News] [Discussion]\nHey everyone! Some pretty interesting stories this week. Most of the headline grabbers were about the coronavirus, but I thought the interoperability stuff was interesting as privacy continues to be a major issue for everyone in 2020.\n\n  \n\n**Everything you need to know about the Coronavirus.**\n\n* At this point, we're all aware of the Coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. Here's the latest updates:\n* While last week the number of infected was [**sitting at 650**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/china-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-634-as-singapore-confirms-first-infection.html) worldwide, the [**total reported cases**](https://apnews.com/74206108b920b6f2680844386ada3bdb) as of this writing is about 2,800. A majority of these infections occurred in Wuhan.\n* 40 total cases have been spotted outside of China - [**5 officially reported**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480001-cdc-confirms-fifth-coronavirus-case-in-us-out-of-arizona) within the U.S.\n* The markets [**sold off**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-slide-on-coronavirus-fears-11580119666?mod=hp_lead_pos1) Monday as fears spread about a potential epidemic. Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and McDonald's are suspending their operations during what is normally a higher level of consumer spending activity in China with Lunar New Year celebrations. [**Here's more info from Axios**](https://www.axios.com/world-worried-coronavirus-stocks-business-c62037ad-0c93-4aec-8b6e-7797c182f888.html) on the potential economic impact of the virus.\n* Officials have [**criticized China's response**](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-centralization-3ae5d7e7-1327-476e-93a9-6ea3e27db450.html) to the outbreak, blaming the regime's tendency for censorship while the virus spreads.\n* The virus is highly contagious and has a somewhat high mortality rate. Companies like J&J and Moderna are [**working on a vaccine**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/jj-pretty-confident-it-can-create-china-coronavirus-vaccine.html), but it could take up to a year to bring it to market.\n* With all of this news coverage, I can't help but think we're all just playing the popular video game Pandemic - which, ironically, saw a [**spike in sales**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/pandemic-video-game-plague-inc-surges-in-popularity-as-coronavirus-spreads-1.4783340) over the weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The latest trend: patients' access to their own health data.**\n\n* Epic, one of the largest electronic health record firms, is NOT at all a fan of HHS' recently proposed health data sharing rules (read about the [**proposed ruling here**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/industry-cheers-spirit-but-not-fine-print-in-hhs-interoperability-rules/556099/)). In an interesting development, Epic's CEO urged its health system partners in an e-mail to oppose the ruling. On Monday, Epic [**told Politico**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/epic-may-sue-hhs-over-interoperability-rules-concerns-judy-faulkner-says.html) that it may sue HHS over the ruling, calling it \"deeply flawed.\"\n* **Stuff about the ruling you should know**: The HHS proposed ruling is designed to provide clearer guidance on how patient health information can be accessed - namely, making it easier for patients to access their own health information. Epic thinks that the ruling will hurt patient privacy (since 3rd parties will have an easier time accessing that info) and wants to work with HHS to establish more appropriate guidelines. \n* **The bigger picture**: HHS' wants to make it easier for patients to access their data across health systems - something that Epic probably thinks is a key competitive advantage of theirs. Think about it. If all electronic health records systems - or other third parties - could easily access patient data regardless of the IT system any one provider is using, it becomes less important to have Epic - or any particular health records platform - as your system. \n* **Who's on board**: Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the Big Tech gang [**are on board with the interoperability proposal**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/apple-microsoft-joining-meeting-promoting-patient-access-to-data.html) and want the policy to go through so that consumers can access their data \"without further delay.\" Epic is definitely feeling the heat. They just [**announced the end of their collaboration**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/epic-systems-warns-customers-it-will-stop-supporting-google-cloud.html) with Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Blue Cross makes a play for generic drugs.**\n\n* Blue Cross Blue Shield wants you to know that it [**invested**](https://www.axios.com/blue-cross-blue-shield-civica-generic-drugs-70ebb81b-9fbb-4a30-8f89-13e42e20bbb4.html) in generic drug company Civica Rx this week to promote the development of generics in the market and cut prescription drug costs.\n* What is Civica Rx? It's a [**nonprofit partnership**](https://civicarx.org/about/) among health systems with the goal of combating drug shortages in hospitals\n* This initiative is growing ever important as generic drugmakers [**producing key drugs like antibiotics are struggling**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/25/health/antibiotics-new-resistance.html) financially.\n\n**Miscellaneous stuff.**\n\n* 2019 set a [**senior care M&A**](https://seniorcare.levinassociates.com/2020/01/17/2019-sets-senior-care-ma-record/) Record\n* Cardinal Health [**recalled 9 million hospital gowns**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-quality-issues-certain-cardinal-health-surgical-gowns-and-packs) this week.\n* What's going on with ADHD prescriptions?

Amazon, IBM, Microsoft also have access to [**millions of medical records through partnerships with health systems across the U.S**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/amazon-ibm-microsoft-have-access-to-millions-of-medical-records-wsj.html).\n* Health systems say that the partnerships, which originally were intended to include de-identified patient data, were not intended to mislead. Rather, once they got down the line, the system realized that it wasn't possible to separate the data that way. As designated business partners under HIPAA, these partnerships are legally permissible. Whether they're good for the consumer remains to be seen.\n* Read the originally reported article from the [**WSJ here**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200).\n\n**SmileDirectClub is in the news again\u2026keep your mouth shut.** \n\n* Before issuing refunds to customers, SmileDirectClub is [**forcing them to sign NDAs**](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077146/smile-direct-club-nda-bad-reviews-online-teeth-aligner-customer-refunds), which prevents those customers from submitting bad reviews of SDC's products online.

It makes sense. Investors get skittish as new government enters the various branches of government, and healthcare is one of the highest regulated industries around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Policy Corner**\n\n**A microscope over hospital mergers.**\n\n* The FTC is planning to [**scrutinize hospital mergers**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ftc-commissioner-pledges-hard-line-on-hospital-mergers/570634/) much closer in 2020 and beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme Court's healthcare flurry.**\n\n* The Supreme Court will [**review religious exemptions**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/supreme-court-review-religious-exemptions-aca-birth-control-coverage) to ACA birth control coverage.\n* The high court also decided last week that it [**won't fast track the ongoing ACA case**](https://www.axios.com/affordable-care-act-supreme-court-2020-election-27c3b536-8d0f-4ae5-a0cc-34d69edef43a.html). It's a loss for Democrats and a win for Republicans. The decision now guarantees that healthcare will be a major talking point on the campaign trail headed into the 2020 election.

                "content": "As others have stated, FMLA exists which protects most workers from repercussions if a medical provider signs off on it. It has limitations, one of which is if the business has less than 50 employees ( could have the number wrong ). It makes sense to have some limitations, if you start a business and have one employee that goes on leave you may not have to pay them but you have to employ a temp to do their job as they may choose to return -- not always feasible, that could bankrupt a business. Even a big corporation like IBM may have to close a division if 5-10% of their staff goes on leave and the cost and risk of training temps is too much (I've definitely read about this happening to people).\n\nAs far as this person's claim, I'll make an unpopular comment : You have literally no idea if this is legit claim worthy of sympathy or not. I've seen people ask for disability accommodations for orthopedic complaints asking to be forgiven for being late daily to their call center jobs, things like that. I would definitely not be so quick to take sides based on a comment on the internet. Why bring it up? How does it relate to reviewing over-sized rubber bands?",

        "content": "Healthcare's 5 Biggest Stories, Week of April Fools - Trump goes for the Obamacare Jugular, Centene buys WellCare, New York bans Unvaccinated Children, and more. [News]\nHey everyone! Back again this week with the top healthcare stories. As always, let me know if you think I missed anything big:\n\n# 1 New York Suburb Bans Unvaccinated Children from the Public\n\n**That seems drastic.**\n\nThis week, Rockland County, a suburb of New York, declared a [**state of emergency**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html) based on the rampant [**measles outbreak**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/measles-outbreak-jews-nyc.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) facing their county's population. The first step? Banning all unvaccinated children and teenagers from public places. This type of action is pretty unprecedented, but so is getting the measles. Although the measles vaccine is about 97% effective, only 72% of the Rockland adolescent population is vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. The ban comes at a time when measles cases through the first 3 months of the year [**have already outpaced**](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/us-measles-cases-surpass-2018-totals-as-outbreaks-spread.html) last year's total reported cases altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2 PBMs going to testify before Congress Wednesday 4/3\n\n**This week's hottest TV.**\n\nTune in to the Senate finance committee hearing this Wednesday to see some absolutely heart-pounding, riveting, must-see TV. Last month in our [**March 4th edition**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-3-4-2019/), we covered lawmakers inviting drugmakers to Capitol Hill to ask why drug costs were so high. Those companies placed 100% of the blame onto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are basically the middlemen between the makers and the patients. Now, the Senate wants to [**ask PBMs some questions**](https://www.axios.com/cvs-trump-drug-pricing-rebate-plan-51bd0100-9be3-4bd7-804a-da9948057533.html) about their drug rebate practices and whether they're ACTUALLY saving patients money on drugs. Companies like CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna are preparing to get grilled come Wednesday, especially as Congress prepares potential legislation around [**abolishing drug rebate practices for good**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/squeeze-looks-more-likely-for-drug-middlemen-11553530346) (paywall).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3 Trump goes for the jugular on Obamacare\n\n**Fuel to the political fire.**\n\nAs if declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional weren't enough, the Trump administration has now declared its intent to [**completely repeal and replace the ACA**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/436153-gop-senators-blindsided-by-trump-on-obamacare)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remind me - what's going on right now?**\n\nIn 2018, the tax bill repealed the ACA's individual mandate, meaning that people who opted not to have health insurance would not longer be penalized for doing so. After this happened, several states took the ACA to court in Texas late in December of last year. In that hearing, a judge [**ruled against the ACA**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/the-affordable-care-act-ruled-unconstitutional-by-tx-federal-judge.html), declaring the entire bill unconsitutional now that the individual mandate wasn't a thing. Of course, the ruling was appealed and is still tied up in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supreme Court Inbound.**\n\nWith heated debates surrounding healthcare on both sides of the aisle, it seems as if a Supreme Court showdown is almost inevitable. Trump thinks he's in good standing considering the currently conservative lean of the bench. But that raises the question - if the lawsuit against the ACA is successful, [**what comes next for healthcare**](https://www.axios.com/justice-trump-court-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-ab8bf281-65fc-4b91-8606-d1f3f65818d6.html)? Because it doesn't look like there's any proposed system to take the ACA's place. The debate around healthcare will only intensify as the administration turns up the heat and 2020 approaches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4 Centene buys WellCare in $17 billion deal\n\n**A Medicaid Giant.**\n\nCentene [**secured**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/centene-17b-wellcare-buy-will-boost-medicare-footprint/551411/) plans this week to purchase its main competitor, WellCare, in a $17.3 billion deal (a 32% premium to their share price). The merger comes at a time when mega-sized healthcare firms are joining forces pretty frequently (think CVS / Aetna, Cigna / Express Scripts, and a whole host of others). What's different about these firms, though, is that they've made their killing mainly by managing Medicaid programs for states. Their businesses really took off under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed for expansion of Medicaid, and thus, the expansion of Centene's and WellCare's businesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not so fast.**\n\nBecause this transaction is a huge 'horizontal' merger in a highly regulated area, this deal is highly likely to raise antitrust concerns. Also, as we just covered above, any existential threat to the ACA would probably REALLY hamstring any further growth available to the new company. If the deal does go through, look for these companies to leverage their size and aggressively target the Medicare Advantage market. Like we talked about in our [**February 11th 3rd story**](https://www.healthymuse.email/healthy-muse-2-8-2019/), Medicare Advantage is growing like a weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 UPS Enters the Home Care Market\n\n**Robots and Drones.**\n\nAs a part of UPS' push into autonomous technology, the parcel giant is partnering with the drone company Matternet to [**deliver lab samples**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ups-teams-up-with-drone-startup-to-deliver-medical-samples-at-north-carolin/551487/) in North Carolina. The pilot program is part of a larger push from UPS into diversifying its revenue streams and changing home delivery as a whole. The approach is pretty innovative. If successful, the program could help seniors receive better and quicker care, all while pushing the lab industry toward an on-demand future (sound familiar, Theranos?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Hits\n\nKeep on the look out for Johnson & Johnson's new drug ad, which will [**disclose**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-to-air-first-tv-ad-for-drug-that-discloses-its-price-11553786572) the cost of a drug for the first time on TV. Following last week's story on the FDA's [**secret medical device database**](https://khn.org/news/hidden-fda-database-medical-device-injuries-malfunctions/), watchdog groups are now [**calling**](https://khn.org/news/device-safety-experts-to-fda-make-data-public/) on the FDA to make all device data public.

        "content": "[Discussion] No Child Without Vaccination, No Family Without Health Insurance: The Political Economy of Public Health in Rwanda\n In just 100 days, almost one million Tutsis, moderate Hutu and Twa were massacred in one of the most brutal episodes of violence n modern history. Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country.\n\nPart of gaining legitimacy to govern is stamping out petty corruption in the bureaucracy. To government regularly takes action such as firing hundreds of [police officers](https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/rwanda-fires-200-police-officers-accused-of-corruption-20170206), or entire departments of the [ministry of health](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Rwanda-fires-health-directors-disbands-medical-tech-unit/4552908-4707022-voekylz/index.html) suspected of corruption and as a result Transparency International's Corruption Index ranks Rwanda the least corrupt Least Developed Country in the world. Moreover, the government has worked assiduously with donors to adapt best practices on institutional design to local circumstances. An example of this is the Imihigo system of to a management. Imihigo refers to a precolonial system where warriors would publicly pledge what they would accomplish in battle, and face humiliation if they failed to achieve those goals. In its modern adaptation, mayors and other higher level officials would pledge to accomplish development goals, and assisted by a large core of elected local leaders in achieving those goals. While the goals were set by the central government, elected leaders have high levels of authority in how goals are to implemented allowing for best practices to spread from district to district.\n\nOne of the greatest successes of the efficient and flexible state is improving public health outcomes in Rwanda. Rwanda today has a life expectancy of 67 and an infant mortality rate of 29, levels of health outcomes similar to much wealthier nations such as India or Bolivia. Part of this success stems from the over 45,000 elected community health workers at the village level. They are generally respected members of the community and tasked with ensuring universal vaccination, and to serve as the first line of healthcare. In order to improve health in a systematic manner, the government has implemented a health insurance system that covers over 90% of the population. The bottom quarter of the population does not have to pay into the system, and even the top .5% of Rwandans only have to pay $9 a month. However, given most Rwandans hover above basic subsistence, it has taken the coercive might of the Rwandan state to make this system financially feasible.\n\n# Suggested Reading\n\n[The politics of state effectiveness in Burundi and\u00a0**Rwanda**: ruling elite legitimacy and the imperative of state performance](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3353/), Benjamin Chemouni\n\n[PERFOMANCE CONTRACTS\u00a0AND SOCIAL SERVICE DELIVERY- LESSONS FROM RWANDA](https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/Policy_Brief_-_Perfomance_Contracts_and_Social_Service_Delivery_-_Lessons_from_Rwanda.pdf) , African Development Bank\n\n[Near universal childhood vaccination rates in Rwanda: how was this achieved and can it be duplicated?](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30176-1/fulltext) , James Bao\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda\\_-\\_economic\\_miracle.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/rwanda_-_economic_miracle.mp3)",

COB is a CON. \n\nAmerican families are wasting so much money by having 2 insurers. I feel this is the biggest ripoff in  healthcare right now and more people need to be educated that having multiple insurance plans does not benefit  them at all. \n\nAmericans are paying hundreds of dollars a month in premiums for secondary coverage that pays pennies on the dollar If anything at all on claims they receive. COB ties up more administrative costs to billing offices and insurance plans than they are worth to patients. Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? People think a secondary insurance will make it so they have no out of pocket costs when going to the doctor, but they are badly misinformed. If the primary insurance has better benefits than the secondary insurance the secondary plan pays NOTHING. People are unknowingly lighting these premiums on fire for a useless plan. \n\nExample as follows: \nPrimary insurance: $15 Co-pay for office visit. \nSecondary Insurance $20 Co-Pay for office visit. When secondary receives the claim they will not pay anything!\n\nPrimary insurance $30 Co-pay\nSecondary Insurance $15 Co-Pay. \nSecondary will only pay $15 on the claim to give patient $15 dollar liability. \n\nWhat is the point of paying premiums for both plans??? Just pick the best one and cancel the other one!!! \n\nSorry for my rant, but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient? This is the biggest scam in America right now and people need to be educated in order to make the best financial decisions for their family. \n\nThis rant is for Commercial plans. Medicare supplemental plans and Medicare Advantage plans are great. \n ",

                "content": ">but has anyone seen COB where it actually benefits the patient?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the time, every day.  I work processing insurance for people who come into the ER for 3 hospitals.  If they don't have two insurances they tend to pay through the nose depending on what it is.  But believe me, for the most part, having two insurances saves people quite a lot.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can argue that it's the ER.  Usually the same person wont go there every day right?  Well there are some really unhealthy people.  And yeah, we see them once a month at least.\n\n\n\n\nSure it depends on the plan too.  Some people have really good plans and having a secondary wouldn't be useful.  But those people on bad plans?  I see charges up to 7K regularly for those with no secondary.  Yeah, that's right.  Their insurance plan has a 7K deductible.  \n\n\n\n\n\n>Fun fact HMO and PPO hardly every coordinate so why try to do it? \n\n\n\n\n\nDon't know where you're getting that from.  I haven't experienced that at all.  But hey I don't know absolutely everything so maybe there's something on the billing end I don't see.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would hesitate to say it's always a rip off.  I've seen way too many situations vary wildly from one person to the next.  Some people, sure, it doesn't work for them.  And they should be educated about it (for instance, dual insurance is actually SUPER good for me due to health issues, but not my husband.  So he's not on my insurance).  But there are just as many people who need it.  You can't pretend everyone's health situation is the same.  It isn't.  Charges vary wildly.  State laws even vary wildly.  I don't think this is a good thing to blanket statement.",

This is a real life scenario many of us have experienced (if you're some sort of health care provider) and this may be interesting to those who are not. The key question at the end of it all is, \"Why are corporations not held to the same responsibilities and values?\"\n\nYou're at an orientation meeting. The CEO, the CMO, the folks from HR and the CIO (and whoever else in the C-suite alphabet soup who wants to seems like they care) are all enthused you're joining the team, but before you get on your feet and be a productive member at this \"state of the art facility\" that \"puts patients first\" they need to you give you their recycled powerpoint lectures. Somewhere within in the middle, or scattered throughout, they're re-telling the story of PIH. I agree. It's important and we should all take it seriously. But let's dissect the nuance of the severely understated double standard.\n\nFor example, a nurse or a physician can't look up the PIH of his/her child. If you do-you're fired or strictly disciplined in some way. You've done something horribly wrong. You're breaking the rules. You're not compassionate about other patient's privacy. You don't care. You're not a good person. How dare you?Unless- you've signed a release for your own child's PHI (in advance) to give *\\_yourself\\_* permission to browse the chart. False alarm, turn off the sirens, it's all okay. The paperwork checks out....\n\nThe lecturer continues to acknowledge the \"*unavoidable*\" circumstances and \"**incidentals**\" as I heard one administrator call it. The patient room that houses two patients. Or the uncontrollably \"packed\" ER. Other patient's in these environments overhear your discussions with the neighboring patient and can learn about his/her illness, and anything about his/her care that is audibly enunciated. But that's okay. It's incidental. We can't avoid that. So try your best to whisper. In this case it's not that serious as we (the corporation) made it out to be compared to when it was your fault. It's our (the corporation) fault now so we'll just call it incidental.\n\nSorry. This is ***not*** right. This is not fair. As a corporation why don't you spend more money and build more rooms. Make all rooms private. Make larger ERs. Instead of \"packing\" the house and creating these so-called \"incidentals.\"\n\nThe amount of control on our lives is ridiculous. Fire me for something the corporations are doing without ownership (no pun intended), but at the same time, function as our moderators and disciplinary authorities.\n\nDouble standard.",

                "content": "No. If you don\u2019t pay the COBRA premium by the deadline, your coverage during the period Nov 1 - Dec 31 is retroactively cancelled. Or maybe it\u2019s retroactively made active when you pay - that part was never explained to me. But unless you pay, you\u2019re not covered for those two months. \n\nHowever, since you say you and your wife are reasonably healthy and you don\u2019t anticipate any major medical bills in the next two months, you could just wait out the time period and as long as you don\u2019t end up needing that insurance, don\u2019t pay. But if something comes up, send in that premium ASAP. (Also, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve shopped around for the best prices and coverage. My COBRA payments and coverage were waaay better than anything I could find on the ACA exchange.)",

What program did you go through?\nI live in MA and i have read about tufts and SNHU having great mph online programs. I want to hear some reviews before picking a college however because i am already in debt from my bachelors degree and dont want to waste money in a program where i take classes that seem pointless to my goals or with teachers who dont seem to care. I am leaning a bit more towards SNHU because of the price but im open to all options. The reason i want to do online is because i currently work as a lab tech and love my job/coworkers but i also need the money so i dont have the option to leave or go part time for more schooling. Any advice, program reviews, and opinions would be appreciated. \n\nAlso i have my BS in Health Science and graduated in 2019 if this helps",

        "content": "[Discussion] Open Enrollment needs to be improved. Do you agree?\n\nOpen Enrollment policies as they are today are the complete antithesis of giving families fair choice and transparency. They also prevent a large number of Americans from being able to shop for the best coverage for their families as insurance companies and businesses change their plans and pricing to adapt to the changing regulations and the economy.\n\nWe need to allow partners eligible to be covered on each other\u2019s insurance to also become eligible to make changes to their company sponsored policy even outside of open enrollment or a major life event OR create a standard open enrollment period for all company sponsored plans. \n\nRead on if you need an example of why and an explanation about open enrollment.\n\nAs most of you probably know, every insurance plan has \u201cOpen Enrollment\u201d meaning that you can switch to a new plan either with the same company or drop and go to a different one. The only other time you can change is during a \u201cMajor Life Event\u201d (spouse\u2019s or your insurance coverage changes - meaning you lose or gain coverage, lose a job, you get married, have or a kid, or an immediate family member dies). \n\nSo, at the same time every year, there is a period during which you can add or remove your partner or kids to your plan, increase or decrease coverage, etc. HOWEVER, these time periods vary across employers.. \n\nWhat this means is that if outside a major life event, my husband and I want to switch from a plan with my employer to his (or vice versa) we to hope that our employers have their open enrollment at the same time or we will need to\n\nA. Have a gap in coverage and take a risk that the new plan won\u2019t be what we want anyway, because the next year\u2019s pricing and plans could change.\nB. Have one of us be \u201cdouble\u201d covered and still paying more if the other plan drops in price.\n\nOpen Enrollment periods have never lined up for us in the last 10+ years, so the only time we can compare is when we are starting new jobs (and that one time we got married - but of course we were working at the same company and it was cheaper to stay as individuals...)",

                "content": "This is a side effect of private healthcare delivery. The rational consumer lowers costs by having a cheap plan until something happens, then switches to a premium plan to lower shared costs after they get sick. So the rational insurance company counters this by limiting when a person can change plans so they usually have to already be paying more to have the better coverage. And most systems were designed when only one person in the family worked so synchronizing wasn\u2019t a priority. \n\nPeople in many countries have everything covered regardless (for less cost), so this is a self imposed problem we can easily solve. But we never do that, so best case is passing a law that sets a national standard for when to do the thing we could otherwise just stop doing.",

        "content": "[Personal Medical Question/Health Advice] No health insurance since January due to a misunderstanding when signing up . Is this acceptable on the part of my employer ?\n\nI work as a healthcare provider in the outpatient setting. We do general medicine. Our office has stayed open for our patients during the pandemic and as expected, we have seen and taken care of a fair number of covid cases (usually mild, not requiring hospitalization ). I think this is our duty and I\u2019m happy we are doing it. \n\nRecently- I needed to have bloodwork done. This essentially led me to discover that I did not have health insurance. I had lost my insurance in January in fact. \n\nHow did this happen? I signed up in October after starting my new job. I verified and made sure - indeed my coverage had started in November. Here\u2019s where things went wrong : my employer was changing the company providing our insurance  and before the new year started,  everyone had to sign up. The conversation I had w the HR person assigned to me made me believe I had registered both for my insurance starting in November as well as in January. Or that the one for Nov rolled over to the next year. I\u2019m sure it was a misunderstanding \u2014but that\u2019s how I remember it. Therefore any emails sent saying \u201cplease sign up\u201d .... well I thought I was ok. \n\nI honestly thought that if something like this ever happened - someone would notice and reach out to make sure I was covered somehow. \n\nThe organization I work for takes good care of their patients and they monitor **everyone\u2019s** work very closely, including my own. This is something well known - they go above and beyond to do so because it holds people accountable and motivates productivity. I have received calls if I didn\u2019t complete X or Y within the time allotted or if I didn\u2019t attend/ sign into a meeting. Sometimes I\u2019m not even sure how they do it. \n\nDuring a pandemic ... it would have been nice to have had someone give me a call about my lack of health insurance. \n\nI\u2019m focussing on covid but ofc other things could happen too. Not having health insurance is a common problem however - so I\u2019m in no way  unique . What concerns me right now is that in doing my job , I\u2019m putting myself at risk and could very easily get sick. I\u2019m happy to take that risk normally but I don\u2019t want to drive my family into bankruptcy if I end up needing the hospital. \n\nI\u2019m just very disappointed. I know I may have misunderstood and should\u2019ve checked earlier - but the repercussions of not doing so seem quite harsh. \n\nThis is my first job so I don\u2019t know if this is just normal. No one at work seemed phased when I mentioned this. Can anyone give me insight?",

        "content": "[Question - Other] inappropriate care in a care home? Should I contact someone?\n[Some background information: I started to work in a care home that states to be *luxury* about 2 months ago (after the lockdown happened). I'm 20 and I never worked in environment like this as I've been at school and just recently dropped out of uni, so I can't compare this care home to any other. All the training was provided by the company during the first 2 weeks and a week before I started to work. Our manager is new in this place as well and she used to work at CQC.]\n\nI work on residential floor, which is supposed to be with people that need a bit of assistance, there's one floor with dementia care, and one floor for nursing care (this one is still closed). On my floor there are 21 people, soon to be 23, and normally there's 3 carers to assist with needs and a senior carer that's always busy doing meds, forms and what not, so we can't really count on them for help. 5 rooms require 2 carers to be present as they need to use hoist. We've got one person with Alzheimer's and her condition got much worse - she can't find her room and whenever we say something to her she either can't hear or doesn't understand and she needs more care. All carers think she should be on dementia floor but the manager hasn't done anything about it for 2 weeks now and it's just getting worse. We are understaffed and some people have to stay on bed until lunch because we are not able to give them basic care, yet we are still open for new admissions. \n\nToday, I was told to make beds while I get people ready and to clean their bathrooms. We always try to make sure they rooms are clean and don't have any waste or rubbish laying around, but we simply do not have time to make beds! People that live there are starting to playing up and do things just for attention because they know that otherwise we are not able to see them. There's not enough cleaning stuff and it's just one cleaner on each floor, and often there's just one host/hostess on each floor and we've got to help them take meals to the rooms, and then we get told off by the manager that it's not our job. \n\nWe had people laying in their urine because they haven't pressed a bell and we haven't been able to check up on them. We have a person that's very unstable on his feet so he was moved opposite to the restaurant where we used to sit to fill out documents and stuff and we could see him, but last week we were told to sit in a small corner where we can't see anyone, so what was the point of moving him?\n\nI'm sorry for the length of this confession, but I don't know what to do. I hope it makes sense but please ask questions if something is not clear - I just finished my 3rd 12 hour day shift in a row and I can't think straight. But they charge for luxury care while we are only able to provide barely basic care!\ud83d\ude22\n\nShould I contact CQC? Will it be anonymous, I don't want to have any trouble?",

I am a graduate student and have a short assignment in a population health class to interview someone about their experience navigating the healthcare system with a chronic illness. The goal is to then reflect on your experience and connect it to what we have learned so far about methods to reduce costs and improve quality in healthcare. My closest family members and friends have not experienced chronic health issues, and thanks to stay-at-home orders I lost social skills and just don't feel like reaching out to an acquaintance for this! Your help would be so appreciated.\n\nIf you could share (or DM me!):\n\n\\- What your illness or chronic condition is\n\n\\- How has your healthcare experience been?\n\n\\- What went well in your experiences?\n\n\\- What does not go well/didn't go well and could be improved?\n\n\\- Did you feel like a partner in your care?\n\n\\- Do you feel like costs are made clear to you?\n\n\\- Do you want costs to be more transparent?",

Unfortunately in today's  corporate America it is sometimes necessary to go to other companies to move up in position, but while you're with Stryker I'd recommend you do well at you current position while making clear to your manager that you want to be in sales. They may be able to make an introduction in a few months. The nice thing about being in a hospital is there there are a lot of reps there, try to network with them from all suppliers. I wish you well. Sales is a very lucrative but difficult career.",

        "content": "[Discussion] what can doctors do to fix healthcare?\nHello, I'm preparing for a med school interview in the States and looking online at some commonly asked questions, I see that one is along the lines of \"what's wrong with healthcare in the US today and how could it be fixed?\" and I realized I really don't even know how to answer that, other than the fact that dozens of millions of Americans are uninsured/underinsured and don't have equal access to healthcare. \n\nI started by looking at the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It turned 10 this year, and seems that the consensus today is that while it has widened the coverage, it has increased premiums for many families. (Please correct me if I'm wrong). Anybody care to speak on how correct this is? What is Obamacare looking like in the time of corona? \n\nIf I were to answer the question of how to make healthcare more affordable, I'd say that one focus should be on preventative care. CDC says chronic illness is responsible for 70% of the nation's annual healthcare costs, even though most are preventable. Early intervention and lots of screening seems to me like it would make a difference. People would also probably go in more if they felt like they could trust the healthcare system, but many Americans hate going to the doctor. I've heard cost transparency and more overall compassionate patient care could help with this. But that doesn't address the cost of things right now. \n\nTo get even more political, i'd say pay cuts and higher taxing of the rich are in order as well. It seems that America is the only country that has not made healthcare a fundamental human right. Also reallocate funding - do we need to spend so much money on national security / defense nowadays? \n\nTLDR ; What are the conversations on healthcare/ the ACA today and in the time of corona? What do people argue for when it comes to solutions to make healthcare more accessible and affordable? What can doctors do? Please link some further reading when possible. I am again, pretty new to these discussions. apologies if this is something frequently discussed on here",

We already spend over twice as much per person (including averaged over people with no access) as most other countries. The total is nearly 4 trillion $. The entire US military budget is less than 1 trillion. \n-\tthis is not a medical issue. Plenty of people in plenty of countries are unhealthy and places like CA and UK that are also overweight etc are still much much cheaper. \n-\tthis is a business problem. Capitalism is a powerful economic tool that can do many things well. But the free market has one critical weakness - it only works well when customers have choice/power\n-\thealthcare in general and employer based healthcare in particular has little choice. The exception that proves this rule is cosmetic surgery. It\u2019s the only sector that\u2019s efficient because it\u2019s the only sector where customers can do things like delay care, shop around, ask for prices.\n-\tthere is one shining example of US healthcare, military tricare. It gets results like in Europe and for prices like Europe. But Americans can\u2019t access it without joining the military. So we know how to do it we just aren\u2019t willing to.",

All of the other have been bought up by one of the parent companies. Do a little research and chances are your insurance company is BCBS, United, Cigna, Atena, Humana, and Kaiser. Same thing in most states. Healthcare companies have bought out mom and pop shops. Rare are the physicians that can afford to practice medicine alone. I have switched from healthcare to social work because I am so disgusted by healthcare. There are people that spit out metrics for corporations. They are for profit. Now, most healthcare companies have also set up a nonprofit foundation of some variety to help fund the overall organization. Here\u2019s the things that I have found that have made universal healthcare hard. The GOP and good old RR made it easier for healthcare corporations to make a profit in the 80\u2019s. Why would they give that up? Also, they have put caps on ligations against physicians and healthcare companies. Meaning if the kill someone and even admit they killed them they can only get sued for so much. It\u2019s also harder for the person bringing the suit to prove it. There are also not enough doctors for universal healthcare. There are also a number of special interest groups that lobby Congress. There is zero standardized on pricing. The exact same procedure can be 6 figures in one part of the country and 4 in another. Also, there\u2019s those that believe once healthcare becomes universal the ability to advance medical treatments and technology will stop. As will medication. Poverty and racism are still huge issues in healthcare as well. Healthcare in America is a huge hot mess. Part of the ACA was to cut payments to providers in an attempt to make them more \u201cefficient.\u201d However, they are doing more work with less money and still wanting to make profits. How many healthcare companies have executives that pull hefty paychecks and bonuses if they make their metrics? How many healthcare insurance company executives pull home multiple millions of dollars?",

You can speak to health reform and political activism, but that is difficult for one individual to impact. Another opportunity, that the ACA did redistribute funds for, is for you to practice in a way that promotes care quality. These are broad concepts but can realistically be influenced by those in the hospital setting through participation in evidence based practice to minimize hospital acquired infections (which are a huge loss for institutions due to loss of reimbursement). So, instead of having a focus on the quantity of patients or procedures, focus on the quality.",

Here's the latest updates:\n* While last week the number of infected was [**sitting at 650**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/china-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-634-as-singapore-confirms-first-infection.html) worldwide, the [**total reported cases**](https://apnews.com/74206108b920b6f2680844386ada3bdb) as of this writing is about 2,800. A majority of these infections occurred in Wuhan.\n* 40 total cases have been spotted outside of China - [**5 officially reported**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480001-cdc-confirms-fifth-coronavirus-case-in-us-out-of-arizona) within the U.S.\n* The markets [**sold off**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-slide-on-coronavirus-fears-11580119666?mod=hp_lead_pos1) Monday as fears spread about a potential epidemic. Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and McDonald's are suspending their operations during what is normally a higher level of consumer spending activity in China with Lunar New Year celebrations. [**Here's more info from Axios**](https://www.axios.com/world-worried-coronavirus-stocks-business-c62037ad-0c93-4aec-8b6e-7797c182f888.html) on the potential economic impact of the virus.\n* Officials have [**criticized China's response**](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-centralization-3ae5d7e7-1327-476e-93a9-6ea3e27db450.html) to the outbreak, blaming the regime's tendency for censorship while the virus spreads.\n* The virus is highly contagious and has a somewhat high mortality rate. Companies like J&J and Moderna are [**working on a vaccine**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/jj-pretty-confident-it-can-create-china-coronavirus-vaccine.html), but it could take up to a year to bring it to market.\n* With all of this news coverage, I can't help but think we're all just playing the popular video game Pandemic - which, ironically, saw a [**spike in sales**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/pandemic-video-game-plague-inc-surges-in-popularity-as-coronavirus-spreads-1.4783340) over the weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The latest trend: patients' access to their own health data.**\n\n* Epic, one of the largest electronic health record firms, is NOT at all a fan of HHS' recently proposed health data sharing rules (read about the [**proposed ruling here**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/industry-cheers-spirit-but-not-fine-print-in-hhs-interoperability-rules/556099/)). In an interesting development, Epic's CEO urged its health system partners in an e-mail to oppose the ruling. On Monday, Epic [**told Politico**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/epic-may-sue-hhs-over-interoperability-rules-concerns-judy-faulkner-says.html) that it may sue HHS over the ruling, calling it \"deeply flawed.\"\n* **Stuff about the ruling you should know**: The HHS proposed ruling is designed to provide clearer guidance on how patient health information can be accessed - namely, making it easier for patients to access their own health information. Epic thinks that the ruling will hurt patient privacy (since 3rd parties will have an easier time accessing that info) and wants to work with HHS to establish more appropriate guidelines. \n* **The bigger picture**: HHS' wants to make it easier for patients to access their data across health systems - something that Epic probably thinks is a key competitive advantage of theirs. Think about it. If all electronic health records systems - or other third parties - could easily access patient data regardless of the IT system any one provider is using, it becomes less important to have Epic - or any particular health records platform - as your system. \n* **Who's on board**: Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the Big Tech gang [**are on board with the interoperability proposal**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/apple-microsoft-joining-meeting-promoting-patient-access-to-data.html) and want the policy to go through so that consumers can access their data \"without further delay.\" Epic is definitely feeling the heat.

        "content": "Why does every great story/franchise/idea end up shite?\nOnce was a time when a sequel, continuation or even reboot (while always potentially bad) *usually* stayed true to the source and expanded on an existing world while respecting it. Aliens and Terminator 2 were both direct continuations and improvements, the first ninja turtle movie was essentially the cartoon come to life, the empire strikes back did not undo the last hope... I know I know there have been plenty of bad sequels and such back then too...\n\nBut it seems worse now. Used to be you had a chance of something getting *better* as it continued, but this is no longer the case. Dexter was great for the first few seasons, Game of thrones redefined epic until about season 6, star trek was good once, so was star wars, one puch season two looks like it was drawn by monkeys, the live action avatar, charlie and the chocolate factory, endgame was ok but was a candle next to infinity war's solar flare (undoing thor's prior arcs is another example of a lack of respect and understanding), breaking bad petered out more than it concluded, alvin and the chipmunks, the list goes on.\n\nAnd the worst part is that it always seems to be the same pattern; intentional decisions are made by people who think they know better (be it the source, or the market) than the creator or the fans of the idea.\n\nThat sonic trailer is an excellent example of just how out of touch these people are. A sonic movie could sell, no doubt there, but no fan of the series, NONE, would have envisioned sonic looking like a six year old in a costume on this earth. Or the 'new' ninja turtles, [remember these guys](https://cdn3.movieweb.com/i/article/mlAOZQMouhmWzGnKVti57BuSDigbUQ/738:50/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-New-Movie-Paramount-2018.jpg), that stylistic choice was a steaming dump on all of us who grew up to them. And that is just the movie/tv industry. On the gaming side we have every single publisher trying to push 'games as a service' which is both a blight on the gaming experience, and a cancer to actual creativity in design. Whereas with music all 'new' releases are the [same song](https://www.mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same), by [the same people](https://nypost.com/2015/10/04/your-favorite-song-on-the-radio-was-probably-written-by-these-two/)\n\nThis may seem like just a pointless rant, and perhaps it is since entertainment itself is kinda pointless from a certain perspective... but I simply cannot understand how we can create something so awesome, then completely miss *what* made said thing awesome while we actively destroy it. Any of the shows I mentioned could have been easily fixed had an actual fan been involved in the creation (rather than someone [who admits they wish to destroy](https://dorksideoftheforce.com/2018/05/17/rian-johnson-destroy-star-wars-fandom/) what they are supposed to be creating)\n\nMy last hope for modern entertainment is The Expanse. But it is a reserved one... Many series lasted longer before jumping a white walker, a lumberjack, or a shark.",

Stallone fired him, hired Harrison Ford instead and tweeted about how happy he was about that.\n\nHe is considered a chore to work with and raised next to people like Megan Fox.\n\nAside from Expendables/ arguably Unbreakable, he wasn't part of any memorable movie/moment in over a decade. The jobs he takes are laughable at best, and worst movie ever made-material at worst (Reprisal). His acting seems often flat and uninterested, he is mumbling all over the place and by now I'm not even sure if he deserves the overwhelming praise he gets for his old, successful movies.\n\nIf he wants to be part of shitty amateur films and overcharge endlessly without doing anything, that's his right to do so. But if you add that most well-known professionals don't even want to work with him anymore and he also believes he is somehow above everyone else (while I can name at least 1 action movie by literally every other successful actor in the same genre which is better than any of his movies), I begin to spot a problem.\n______\n\nWhat do you think? Did Bruce ruin his reputation by now or do his accomplishments from the past justify his actions? Is he a lazy fuck or a financial genius? Do you still watch movies just because he's in them?",

                "content": "So one question I have after reading the article is where did the grants come from? Were the people writing the grants employed by times up?\n\nThe reason I ask is is that is a lot of money to come into the firm to help pay for these lawsuits. If the money came because this nonprofit is employed full-time grant writers then that is a good use of the money.\n\nI wish the article was written a little bit better. As an example it doesn\u2019t mention that the foundation has not registered as a nonprofit and filed the correct IRS forms to be transparent with where their funds are going. This means somebody donates to this \u201ccharity\u201c they cannot write off that donation as it is not an official nonprofit. That would\u2019ve been a better angle to take in explaining the problems involved with this organization.",

        "content": "Fact-Checking the James Gunn Controversy\n*[This was originally posted on r/movies, but was taken down for an unknown reason. People have requested it, so I am re-posting this here with some corrections]*\n\nOver the last month there\u2019s been a ton of posts and opinion in Reddit about James Gunn\u2019s firing by Disney. The hardest thing I\u2019ve realized has been separating opinion and rationale from facts about the situation. I found heavily upvoted comments/posts were sometimes false or misleading. I want to use this time to dispel some myths about the controversy so at least people can make an informed opinion about what to think about the situation. For the purposes of this post \u201coffensive tweets\u201d refers to the tweet from 2008 and following that were about rape, pedophilia, and similarly sexual topics that were used as grounds for firing Gunn as director for Guardians of the Galaxy. \n\n(Note: Given some common reception upon he first posting consider the following: This post assumes that these tweets a) were dark/blue humor jokes and b) they led to Gunns firing. Many Redditors lamented that the \"context\" of all the jokes was not added and thus they looked worse in this fact-checking post. The aforementioned sentence is the proper and necessary context; when others complain about further \"context\" it seems they are really asking for a defense of Gunn's humor, tweets, or Gunn himself. Such as claim can be made, but is subjective and thus not the purpose of the post. This is no greater context that would change any of the findings. The \"badness\" of the tweets is beyond the ability of fact-checking. )\n\nThis posts uses the truth ratings used by [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/about/) and it's affiliates.\n\n**1. \u201cJames Gunn made the tweets a decade ago\u201d**\n\nI hear this a lot, it\u2019s a pretty easy on the understand. James Gunn did make a living as a provocateur for some time, and these are largely in his past. This claim is mentioned by the Guardians of the Galaxy cast and Gunn himself in his post-firing apology. However, it not always clear where the end date was. James Gunn has since deleted his tweets, but the most wildly circulated screen caps are from tweets search from 2008 and as late as 2012.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/LRosgGp\n\nIt would only make sense to use the end date of the tweets for describing when the were from, not the beginning since that would be misleading about when they occurred. So, while some of the offensive tweets are definitely from \u201ca decade ago\u201d in 2008, there are also at least three are from as late as 2012, just six years ago. Calling this time period a \u201cdecade\u201d effectively ignores nearly half of the time span. There are no documented tweets from before 2008 that would help balance this claim. It's stretch to call a period of 6 years \"nearly a decade\" and is simply incorrect to definitely call it \"a decade\", however a large amount can be comfortably placed in the \"decade\" range. This is half-true.\n\n**HALF-TRUE**\n_____________\n\n**2. \u201cJames Gunn apologized for these offensive tweets long ago\u201d**\n\nThis line specifically became central to the defense of Gunn from Redditors, writers and even the Guardians of the Galaxy cast themselves. In their open letter the cast stated \u201c[Gunn\u2019s] apology, now and from years ago when first addressing these remarks\u2026\u201dto show how the Gunn they know is not the one being portrayed recently. In Gunn\u2019s recent firing-related statement he says something similar stating \u201c\u201cIn the past, I have apologized for humor of mine that hurt people. I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies.\u201d I found this claim interesting, and important. It would certainly affect the situation had Gunn already addressed his offensive tweets; and to only have them brought up in a Twitter spat years later to discredit him would be odd. I searched for a formal acknowledgment and apology from Gunn and asked fellow Redditors who used this claim for a source. The source provided was also the only apology I could find, which was in 2012.\n\nThe apology was addressing a blog post Gunn made a year earlier in February 2011 called \u201cThe 50 Superheroes You Most Want to Have Sex With.\u201d The blog came under fire for \u201cjokes\u201d and statements that appeared anti-gay and sexist to many readers. In he calls Gambit a \u201cfruit\u201d, suggesting the lesbian Batwoman needed a Tony Stark to \u201cturn\u201d her straight, and claimed one hero with ultimate daddy issues \u201cmeans she\u2019s just my type\u201d. When Flash was suggested by gay men, Gunn stated \u201cI have no idea why this is. But I do know if I was going to get fucked in the butt, I too would want it to be by someone who would get it over with quick.\u201d When popular gay-rights organization GLAAD reached out to Gunn about the post he said the following:\n\n>\u201cA couple of years ago I wrote a blog that was meant to be satirical and funny. In rereading it over the past day I don't think it's funny. The attempted humor in the blog does not represent my actual feelings. However, I can see where statements were poorly worded and offensive to many. I'm sorry and regret making them at all. People who are familiar with me as evidenced by my Facebook page and other mediums know that I'm an outspoken proponent for the rights of the gay and lesbian community, women and anyone who feels disenfranchised, and it kills me that some other outsider like myself, despite his or her gender or sexuality, might feel hurt or attacked by something I said. We're all in the same camp, and I want to do my best to make this world a better place for all of us. I'm learning all the time. I promise to be more careful with my words in the future. And I will do my best to be funnier as well. Much love to all\u201d\n\nHere Gunn addresses the comments made in the Superhero post that were criticized for being anti-gay and sexist and clearly apologizes. However there is no attempt to apologize nor even acknowledge the offensive tweets or making rape or pedophilia jokes. Gunn also touts his support for gay rights specifically since that was the charge he was be accused of at the time. \n\nIn a 2017 Buzzfeed article titled \"Marvel's Dark and Twisted Guardian: The Maniac who conquered Marvel\", Gunn is interviewed in an article that is about Gunn's career in dark and perverse indie movies. Naturally Gunn's similar Twitter activity comes up with Gunn describing how becoming a big Hollywood blockbuster director affected him:\n\n>I protect myself by writing scenes where people shoot people in the face,\" Gunn said, chuckling. \"And if I have to think around shooting someone in the face, it's harder, but I think it's more rewarding for me.\" He cleared his throat. \"I felt like Guardians forced me into a much deeper way of thinking about, you know, my relationship to people, I suppose. **I was a very nasty guy on Twitter. It was a lot fucking edgy, in-your-face, dirty stuff. I suddenly was working for Marvel and Disney, and that didn't seem like something I could do anymore. I thought that that would be a hindrance on my life.** But the truth was it was a big, huge opening for me. I realized, a lot of that stuff is a way that I push away people. When I was forced into being this\" \u2014 he moved his hand over his chest \u2014 \"I felt more fully myself.\"\nAnd what's \"this\"?\n\"Sensitive, I guess?\" he said. \"Positive. I mean, I really do love people. And by not having jokes to make about whatever was that offensive topic of the week, that forced me into just being who I really was, which was a pretty positive person. It felt like a relief.\"\n\nHere Gunn clearly acknowledges his past as a Twitter provocateur and being a \"nasty guy\". However the statement does not approach regret nor an apology in any way, instead describing how him moving up in the world meant he had to leave that behavior behind and ultimately became more \"positive\". Furthermore with this statement being made last year, it also does not satisfy the additional claim condition of being \"long ago\". While he did apologize in the 2012 statement, he clearly was addressing \u201cthe attempted humor in the blog\u201d, and it is not accurate to say that in his 2012 apology to GLAAD Gunn apologized for the offensive tweets that apparently related to his firing. It is also no accurate to say his Buzzfeed interview amounted to an apology for the tweets. This is mostly false.\n\nhttps://www.glaad.org/blog/director-james-gunn-apologizes-anti-gay-and-sexist-comments-blog-post\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy?utm_term=.wtOenezOw#.sc0X3Xpxo\n\n**MOSTLY FALSE**\n_____________\n\n**3. Gunn is the victim of a right-wing takedown because he disapproved of Trump. Ironically, Gunn\u2019s accuser who published the old tweets, Mike Cernovich is a racist, sexist, conspiracy pushing, rapist.**\n\nA large part of the narrative defending Gunn has been that his demise was a coordinated attack by right-wing trolls who cared less about the offensiveness of his tweets, and more about his unrelated political views. The idea of a celebrity being taken down by an online conspiracy is nothing new. Roseanne, Milo Yiannopoulous, and other figures have all contended that they are being attack by a vast conspiracy for who they are not what they said. The claims made against Cernovich being a rapist where also extremely strong and if true would certainly make Gunn\u2019s firing laced with a bit of obvious contradiction.\n\nHowever Cernovich seems to be proud of his part in taking Gunn down and has admitted to being locked in a war with the media and made an effort take people down via tweets. One of his tweets in 2017 said:\n\n>\u201cYes I watched what he did to conservatives and thought, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do that to his side?\u201d It\u2019s worked rather well and we found over 100 far left wing journalists with fireable tweets. 2018 this project goes live.\u201d\n\nAfter getting into an argument with Gunn regarding President Trump, Cernovich, rather than engage in a defense of his beliefs, did as he promised he scoured old tweets to discredit Gunn. Cernoivch does this to \u201cmake sure liberals are held to the same standards\u201d. (It\u2019s unsure if Cernovich thinks this applies to himself as well)\n\nCernvoich also campaigns on conspiracy theories such as \u201cPizzagate\u201d, and is not stranger to going after anti-Trump forces. Cernoivch got his start a in anti-feminist \u201cpickup artist\u201d circles and has worked his way into denouncing \u201cwhite genocide\u201d and other propagating other alt-right ideas. He became obsessed with the notion of false rape allegations from women against men, and in 2012, he tweeted \u201cdate rape doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, and in 2011 stated in a blog that \u201cI like choking a woman right up until her eyes almost go lifeless\u201d. He further went to seemingly pro-rape sentiment with tweets saying \u201cA whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case. So why should I care when women are raped?\u201d and \u201cRape via an alpha male is different from other forms of rape. We can\u2019t really understand this, as our culture is too detached from instinct.\u201d As for rape allegations, Cernovich has been accused of rape and was charged in 2003 but plead it down to a misdemeanor battery charge. Cernovich describes this has him beating the system despite apparently justifying rape in certain situations in his tweet.\n\nIts true that Cernovich targeted Gunn due to his anti-Trump views and he is a extremist monitored by the SPLC that promotes racist and sexist language. The charge of him being a rapist technically falls a bit short despite his plead-down battery conviction and apparently affinity for the idea. This claim is mostly true\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/mike-cernovich\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-cernovich-james-gunn-fired_us_5b5265cce4b0fd5c73c570ac\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/why-did-fox-news-welcome-date-rape-apologist-mike-cernovich\n\n**MOSTLY TRUE**\n_____________\n\n**4. \u201cAfter James Gunn apologized, he changed and stopped making offensive rape/pedophilia jokes.\u201d**\n\nThe idea or change and reform is often an idea brought up in this discussion. There\u2019s certainly plenty that could be said about when and why people should be held responsible for previous behavior and what constitutes change that begs forgiveness. As Forbes points out \u201cthe tweets were written several years ago, and you could assume that Gunn has matured in the time since, except for the awkward fact that he was forty when he wrote them. The tweets sound exactly like the \u2018edgy\u2019 humor of a fourteen-year-old - the man was way too old to be so amused by the concept of pedophilia.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2018/07/21/the-strange-story-of-james-gunn/#3ba2d25be019 \n\nStill its been said that since his apology in 2012 regarding his anti-gay blog posts was a moment of awareness and change for him and he stopped making offensive jokes. The GLAAD-pushed apology came in November 2012, yet the following tweets occurred near or after the apology:\n\nNovember 2012: \u201cWatching Trapped in the Closet, R Kelly\u2019s second best video after the one where he urinates on a child\u201d December 2012: \u201c \u2018Eagle Snatches Kid\u2019 is what I call it when I get lucky\u201d. ( This joke riffs of a popular Youtube hoax by the same name.) By looking at the available tweets in question, its clear the one made in December 2012, a month or so after his GLAAD apology, is completely consistent with the type of pedophilia-esque humor Gunn has used since 2008. While there is no accounting for any internal change in Gunn in his heart or mind, and the majority of the known tweets occured prior to the apology, there\u2019s proof he tweeted similarly at least once after. This is mostly false.\n\n**MOSTLY FALSE**\n_____________\n\n**5. \u201cGunn never targeted or mentioned anyone specifically with his offensive tweets\u201d.**\n\nThis statement is also a common line used by Gunn\u2019s defenders usually when defending Gunn from Rosanne comparisons. The comparison between Roseanne and Gunn is expected given both were fired by Disney for offensive tweets. One of the pivotal arguments commonly used as to why the situations are inherently different is that Roseanne targeted an actual person with an offensive \u201cjoke\u201d but Gunn\u2019s tweets about sexual assault and pedophilia where not about actual people. While it\u2019s debatable whether that makes a significant difference in the appropriateness of the comments, the fact of whether he ever used real people in his offensive tweets is certainty a point looking into. Most of Gunn\u2019s tweets from 2008-2012 are about hypothetical sexual interactions with children or women, however he did rarely mention real people.\n\nIn 2008 Gun tweeted:\n>\u201cLeading in Votes on which American Idol Contestant I should Rape: Sanjaya with 12 votes, followed by Constantine with 3\u201d \n\nIn 2010 Gunn tweeted:\n >\u201cRT @lloydkaufman The first time I masturbated to Justin Bieber it was a joke, but now I can\u2019t stop! He like jerk off crack! #fakeretweet\u201d \n\n(Bieber was 16 years old at the time)\n\nIn 2011 Gunn tweeted \n>\u201cPhoto shoot with @Amalea, @steviesparkle, & @Melissa_Pizza. Trying to maintain a semi-chub so that I\u2019ll Look impressive in these photos. \n\n(The ages of the people mentioned are in debate)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr\n\nThere is no objective determination to be made how the \"badness\" of these tweets, but only the fact that Gunn's dark, sexual humor did mention real people a few times. (TO BE CLEAR: This is not to say the situations are the same since it includes a strong layer of subjectivity immune to fact-checking.)While it can be argued there are other differences between Gunn and Roseanne\u2019s Twitter controversies, and it was not Gunn\u2019s MO to direct his rape and sexual tweets towards real people, he most certainly did so on at least three documented occasions. This is false.\n\n**FALSE**\n_____________\n\n**6. \u201cAfter the controversy Gunn deleted 10,000 pedophilia endorsing tweets.\u201d**\n\nThis one is propagated by Cernovich himself, who after claiming victory sought to worsen the blow by claiming gun had deleted 10,00 tweets about pedophilia. While is true that Gunn did delete years and years of tweets, there\u2019s only evidence of a most several dozens tweets filled with objectionable sexual content, and even less about pedophilia. The 10,000 figure likely describes the total number of tweets Gunn deleted in order to remove objectionable or offensive conduct around the time he was fired. While it was his intend to remove any tweets that joked about endorsing pedophilia there's no evidence to suggest the number approached 10,000 and all evidence suggest is was closer to around 3-5. This statements some elements of truth but presents it to give an largely misleading claim. However the crux of the claim is about the amount of pedophilia tweets deleted and thus the amount Gunn had originally. Given the gross overstatement, and since that is the intent of this claim is simply FALSE. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr\n\n**FALSE**\n_____________\n\n**7. \u201cJames Gunn is a child rapist/molester\u201d**\n\nThis is another charge that has been propagated by Cernovich and his cronies. It feeds into a common right-wing line that Hollywood is a huge child rape complex, and figures in the business who try to expose the conspiracy ( and are coincidentally right-leaning or conservative) are taken down or attacked. Many alt-right people use this explanation for Mel Gibson\u2019s downfall, and now are using it to defend Cernovich and actual criminal wrongdoing on Gunn. (Again this seems odd given Cernovish\u2019s stated views on rape.) While abuse of children is certainly a problem in Hollywood, and Gunn\u2019s tweets on rape and child abuse certainly don\u2019t help his case, there\u2019s nothing to indicate Gunn was carrying out his statements and that they are nothing more than a very juvenile form of shock humor. Gunn felt the need to say this explicitly in his most recent apology, and no one has publicly come forward to claim otherwise let alone charge him with any crime. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that these tweets, no matter how gross or objectionable some may find them, were anything else but jokes and attempts at humor. This is false.\n\n**FALSE**\n_____________\n\nAny SPECIFIC factual corrections to these points are welcome. Thank you to those who have helped make this more factually accurate.",

That's not unavoidable, but I don't want it to be a central struggle of my career. \n\nPlease help. Feedback from those with either degree would be appreciated. \n\n(Things that have excited me and felt fulfilling from previous work have been: preparing and delivering testimony in front of city council, creating a population inclusive communication and outreach program strategy to implement state health agency services, problem solving policy implementation procedures that impact service accessibility and equity. I've been told I am a skilled public speaker, and good with pop-specific messaging. I enjoy planning and working through program/issue strategy.)",

So not worth the student debt, it would be more wiser to get a degree in something more marketable (economics, MBA.. statistics) and with those degrees it would be easier getting the same jobs as MPP graduates get. But what the MPP would do is give you a set of potential friends and opportunities that you would not have access to.. not because you are not qualified but because you are lazy. It is easy to find opportunities in grad school all you need to do is read your emails and walk around campus, but you would need to work hard and put in some effort to find those same opportunities now even without going grad school. Now is that 'easy' access worth the debt?\n\nNot really, because this field is only available to those people who are already rich. Go to any NGO or IO and you will find a whole lot of people with fancy degrees and rich parents. There are soooo many people who graduate with a undergraduate degree in 'something to change the world of politics' and then there are those who graduate with a masters in 'deeper focus on something to change the world' including about \\~600 from harvard kennedy \\~500 from columbia SIPA, \\~400 from hopkins SAIS  \\~ 500 from Georgetown. These are the top of the line kids and each year these schools pump out these numbers of students who want to work in the NGO, IO and every field you want to work for.. note that I didnt even include other schools like GW, AU, and hundreds of schools around the world which are equally better..\n\nCan all these kids get a IO or NGO job? the answer is No. look at the average salary of kids graduating Harvard Kennedy Masters in MPP , it is \\~$60K with an average graduate age of 28. That tells you all. Other kids getting MBAs are pulling \\~$130k+ at average age of 30.\n\nAs unfortunate as it is.. only the sons and daughters of rich folks make it in the field, if you do pursuit the path you will soon realize that you only have ppl who were well off to start with, not because of corruption or lack of motivation but simple economics of the field. You have so many ppl who want to be in the field thus the pay is so little.. and then you turn 30 or at most 35 and then realize you want to help the world but better yet you want to help yourself and your family first so you decide to leave.. while those kids with rich parents can afford to live with crap paying jobs helping the world and being subsidized by their parents.\n\nWell here you go. If you want to work in Service sector like the Federal government, then you dont need a masters degree. Just apply to 1000 postings on USAjobs and you might just be lucky.",

Ideally, I\u2019d end up at an international organization such as USAID or a more traditional consulting firm such as Bridgespan or Dalberg. I posted this in /r/mba but didn\u2019t get much feedback since I\u2019m not targeting M7 or a traditional consulting path. I would like to get an MPP/MBA as I feel it would be beneficial to navigate the business and policy path that I want to work within. \n\nBackground    \n\n\u2022 Work experience: non-profit management background. I organized over 1000 people in multiple different programs in a non-profit youth sport for 5 years.    \n\u2022 Extra curriculars: Coach youth soccer, volunteer during tax season, the coaching takes up a ton of time. I\u2019ve been getting involved in an urban development nonprofit as well and helping with their communications, but nothing significant. My first job out of college was working on a campaign for a nationally important senate race. I\u2019m currently trying to network into something more policy orientated now.     \n\u2022 Undergrad school/major: Graduated in 2010 from my state\u2019s flagship university in political science/2.8 GPA (I know....ugh. I trended upward pretty hard.).  \n\u2022 Other education/coursework: MS Sports Administration/3.75 GPA (2017) and working on an MS Accounting/3.78 GPA (planned Dec 2019).  \n\u2022 Race/nationality: White/American.  \n\u2022 Sex: Male.  \n  \nStats  \n\u2022 GMAT Score (include breakdown!): GRE 320 (160/160), took GRE because the MPP requires it.   \n\u2022 Undergrad GPA: 2.8.  \n  \nMBA Info  \n\u2022 Goal of MBA: I would like to transition into internal consulting within the government, particularly in international aid and environmental funding. Ideally, I\u2019d end up at USAID or a similar organization.  \u2022 Target schools: I\u2019m not aiming too high, Georgetown\u2019s MBA/MPP dual degree is my goal but my reach would be at UVA\u2019s MBA/MPP or Carnegie\u2019s MBA/MPP Program. \nHonestly, my goal is to work in DC. I\u2019d like to be a policy advisor someday. Failing that, I will stick with consulting and like to work for a firm like Dalberg or Bridgespan. I should also say that I\u2019m considering an MPA from NYU as well.  ",

I sent in my resume, then was asked for a writing sample, then invited to do a case study, then a video-call discussion, and now I will be going in for a final interview next week. I'm an out of state applicant, that's why there hasn't been any in-person contact as of yet.   I am interested, and they seem to be too - at least enough to invite me for a final. I'll be meeting executive leadership, senior-level leadership, as well as a lunch with recent hires.\n\n  \nI will obviously prepare for this just as I have for every other step in this process - a  lot and slightly obsessively. lol BTW, this position is the exact one I  want for my career, and feel like I am qualified for it too.\n\n   \nWhat do you think about my chances?

These are the top of the line kids and each year these schools pump out these numbers of students who want to work in the NGO, IO and every field you want to work for.. note that I didnt even include other schools like GW, AU, and hundreds of schools around the world which are equally better..\n\nCan all these kids get a IO or NGO job? the answer is No. look at the average salary of kids graduating Harvard Kennedy Masters in MPP , it is \\~$60K with an average graduate age of 28. That tells you all. Other kids getting MBAs are pulling \\~$130k+ at average age of 30.\n\nAs unfortunate as it is.. only the sons and daughters of rich folks make it in the field, if you do pursuit the path you will soon realize that you only have ppl who were well off to start with, not because of corruption or lack of motivation but simple economics of the field. You have so many ppl who want to be in the field thus the pay is so little.. and then you turn 30 or at most 35 and then realize you want to help the world but better yet you want to help yourself and your family first so you decide to leave.. while those kids with rich parents can afford to live with crap paying jobs helping the world and being subsidized by their parents.\n\nWell here you go. If you want to work in Service sector like the Federal government, then you dont need a masters degree. Just apply to 1000 postings on USAjobs and you might just be lucky.",

Governments, nonprofits, and other entities are increasingly motivated or required to analyze the impact of policies and programs on outcomes as more and more social and cultural programs and funding to higher ed is on the chopping block. For instance, recent administrations have pushed for more rigorous benefit-cost analysis and effectiveness demonstrations before new regulations and programs could be pursued. All of this requires individuals with the skills taught in Master of Public Policy programs. The great thing about the MPP is that you have a wide variety of [career options](https://publicpolicy.psu.edu/careers) with U.S. and International government positions, non-profits, health care, private sector companies, consultants, etc. Here are some [links](https://prodigyfinance.com/resources/blog/getting-masters-public-policy-expect-salary-bump) to articles that can tell you more about the [salary](https://study.com/articles/Career_and_Salary_Info_for_a_Masters_in_Public_Policy_Degree.html) and [locations](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Master_of_Public_Policy_(MPP)/Salary) for positions available with an MPP degree.

        "content": "Thinking about leaving the family farm for a few years\nSo my future fiance and I really want to move to Montana but I farm with my dad on the side (I have like 40 acres while he has 1,000). So I help him when I can but I have a full time job. I\u2019m 30 years old and I\u2019ve always lived in the same area. Me and my gf idea is to move away for a few years and come back. I\u2019ve thought about being an owner operator truck driver so I could take off and help him for planting and harvest time but we will see. My doubts is I\u2019m scared honestly, he\u2019ll be by himself again and he\u2019s 66 but he\u2019s not retiring anytime soon and the farm is his only income. Also scared I\u2019m leaving a good full time job (doesn\u2019t make me rich but it\u2019s fun). I guess I also know my parents will be sad. Like I said I only want to do it for a few years. Still thinking about it as I have been for a few weeks now so I know I need more time to think it over ",

        "content": "Considering a career change, need advice\nHello everyone,\n\nI am currently a perennial fruit crop grower and want to transition into ag biotech research. Specifically I am interested in helping develop new biopesticides to help slowly move the industry away from conventional chemistries that are slowly being phased out due to resistance. I would like to do this either in a lab setting or field trial/grower relations type work. Anyone have any experience in this field or made a similar transition (grower to researcher) and have any advice? It looks like getting a masters degree is a good move as I find it difficult to even establish connections in this adjacent field and there isn't much of the industry in my area. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this but any advice is greatly appreciated! ",

The federal government is just like every other business, it needs to cut expenses and payroll is one of the biggest. Unlike private companies, the federal government just keeps adding employees and never reduces or eliminates FTE that aren't needed. The concept of downsizing or completely scrapping entire departments is foreign to federal employees but its part of keeping the business (or government) efficient. If a private company ran like the federal government does... it would have been bankrupt 100 times over. Its nearly impossible for a bureaucracy to be objective enough to make the altruistic recognition that they are not needed or no longer serve a useful purpose. Even assuming the best intentions, they are too close to it... with more realistic motives, they are intentionally obfuscating to keep jobs they know arent needed.\n\nAll the farmers I know all see the USDA as legal gangsters running a protection racket. The only ones that benefit from the USDA activities are the BigAg companies... not farmers. Farmers like us are the only business model in the US that have to buy input supplies from BigAg at RETAIL prices and then sell their finished products (crops or meat) at wholesale prices.  The USDA and the bureaucrats within are all owned by BigAg through the lobbying done. Get rid of the bureaucracies and start from the ashes to build a slimmer and trimmer set of groups once you see what's needed.\n\nLike I said... I've been laid off several times over my life and the companies always came out of those layoffs stronger... and smart people (educated or not) always find something else.",

                "content": "So based on the argument laid out, the  primary reason you've articulated for pushback against the shrinking of government in this case is a procedural one. I respect your position if you're saying that the REASON for firing would somehow prevent them from getting unemployment benefits or another job one day. If thats a technical issue that prevents them from doing something like collecting unemployment... then sure change the reason on the document. But still fire them.\n\nI must however disagree on your comment about the private sector not doing the same thing. The large layoffs in private sector roles often cite reasons that are inconsistent with reality and later are seen to be demonstrably false. Thats life. Unfortunately with these government jobs, it becomes nearly impossible to fire employees for any reason except a job performance clause. That creates lifelong bureaucrats who, like teachers with tenure, can't be fired... even if you determine you don't need them. Most would agree that any entity looking to remain solvent cannot operate in an environment where you cannot fire people in large numbers at will. For example, if the Tulsa OK location of a private company was not profitable or the company no longer wants to do business in that location, then they should have every right to layoff that entire staff. The federal government is no different, it has to be efficient and have the ability to lay off workers in large numbers. \n\nIf the scenario was changed to an individually owned business, no rational person would argue that the mom and pop owner of the business can't fire as many employees as they need to to remain solvent. For the government to force the owner to continue to pay employees, even if the business is overburdened with debt and insolvent, would be tantamount to indentured servitude on the owners part. If we replace the individual owner now with the American people... that's what we're arguing here. The American people should, through elected officials in the executive branch, be entitled to fire as many employees as needed to make the company solvent again.\n\nYou and I can find common ground on changing the REASON for firing these employees if there is an option to do that, but sadly the layoffs need to occur to reduce the size and expense of the government.",

I no longer pay you to do a role.  In private firms or government, there should be a way to lay-off (or fire) people on whatever timeline is needed.  Now, I agree that giving people as long of a time as possible is a kindness that would be optimal, but that's not a luxury we have given the debt we're in.  The longer we wait to do this, the more apathy sets in to make the changes.  Bureaucracies love long time lines and red tape because it protects the status quo... in this case... out of control spending on unnecessary staffing at agencies like the USDA. \n\nBecause of unions and bureaucracy at the highest orders in federal government (and state governments for that matter), there is often no logical way to immediately reduce payroll.  That is essential to running a large scale environment where millions of dollars go out the door on payroll every month.  When you see that you're in debt up to your ears, you need a way to immediately reduce that payroll expense.\n\nWe can debate all we want, but your statements about humane and timelines are all stalling tactics when action is needed.  The only things guaranteed are \"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\" and nowhere in that list is a RIF window for your job.  There's also no mention of \"severance\" payouts listed there.  These are all nice cushy things that normal average Americans don't often get when they are laid off or fired.  That's why a large population of people have empathy for the people in these situations but also see their roles in government as overly valuated compared to average blue collar workers in the US. \n\nCall it a firing.  Call it a RIF. Either way, the government payrolls should be drastically cut in days... not months to help right the ship and we need to use the mechanism available to do that.  The next thing to go needs to be drastically cut will be government programs that are highly exploited and extremely inefficient.",

I'm talking maybe a few grand to sort out an entire farm with all sorts of sensors and agricultural analysis that they can setup.\n\nI was very enthusiastic, had lots of ideas, have domain names to build a community with the 3D printer community, and create a marketplace store, so anyone in the agri or maker community can make and sell products (ideally to a set standard).\n\nI wanted to make products that could be bulk built if needed, or made on the small scale that could connect to free and open source dashboards or systems, and were easy enough to set-up for busy farmers, but still reliable and weatherproof.\n\nOne forum I was engaging with started demanding money, the farmers had no real interest (I think partly because I used the term 'smart farming') and were dismissive that anyone would want to help out the farming community out of the goodness of their heart, for the future of the country.\n\nPerhaps they've all been screwed over before with other initiatives that cost tens or hundreds of thousands...\n\nI even offered to supply a farm with tech to test it out before releasing the plans. No one wanted to do it. Such a shame.\n\nI had the idea ages ago, and was spured on by Clarkson's Farm to help out.\n\nAnd they dumped their (emotional) ineptitudes on me like a truck full of horse shit...\n\nSo I stopped that last year, and am not going back.\n\nI've seen reports that farmers are at the highest risks of mental health issues?\nWell, maybe, because from an outside perspective, they're not willing to even talk about getting help (for themselves) and support from the tech community, basically for free, to improve and increase yeilds.\n\nIt seems they are mostly so stubborn, they just don't want to change... I understand financial skepticism, but this was a surprising lack of willingness to welcome support from the wider community.\n\nHas anyone had any success in building their own IoT or 'agri-tech' devices? Anyone from the tech or maker communites looking into this in 2025?",

Then you need to find avenues to connect with the subset of farmers who are more experimental and do larger scale testing with them. Then you are ready to approach the wider farm industry with your offering. And through out the process, if you don't learn it through the experience, you need to remind yourself to be humble because you're dealing with people who's entire livelihood is dependent on producing real world results, not theory.",

But it's incredibly expensive, and rarely customisable without paying out a LOT. \nFor most. It's just not worth it, or out of reach.\n\nEspecially for those in rural areas where technicians can't get quickly if there's an issue.

Is that a fair way to paraphrase?\n\nI can certainly see a use for that, if I wanted a way to monitor and log some parameters in my greenhouse such as temp, humidity, light levels, etc, that's a pretty intimidating prospect for a busy person who's not great at programming, and purchasing an industry standard system is probably prohibitively expensive for a small producer. If there was a reputable community hub that I knew had all the resources and guides I could need for creating and implementing my own reliable monitoring setup for a fraction of the price of purchasing one, I would be all over that. Especially if it gave me enough understanding of the technology that I was confident I'd be able to fix it myself and even add more functions later, and be able to process the data into something useful (or explained how to have AI do that).\n\nIf you were to pursue this again, my two cents would be that most farmers are de facto engineers, it's a major component of what they're actually doing every day, and most advances in farm tech come from farmers themselves solving their own problems or seeing an opportunity to do something differently, and sometimes hiring someone with the specialized knowledge to do so. I'd also suggest that the only way to develop your idea further is to learn through doing, get out there and meet some farmers and pick their brains about their production systems until you can see a spot where a sensor system could be implemented, and convince them to build and implement something basic together. Probably an exchange of help of some sort on their farm to allow you to learn through your experimental research phase. I don't think forums and really the internet are the best place to really learn and understand in the way that you need to, that place is going to be talking directly with a variety of producers about their systems with your boots on the ground.",

I also know that hardwood stands are typically early-successional species in boreal forests, and don't usually persist in stands for more than a hundred years or so, as they are eventually overtopped and shaded out by conifers.\n\nSo my question is obviously what accounts for the extensive and persistent aspen forests in central Alberta? I am going to go out on a limb (har har) and guess that it has something to do with the Rocky Mountains, but that's about all I've got. You can stop here if you haven't already. Thanks very much!\n\n(If you kept reading, I have some follow-up questions, which are much more speculative: first, whether these forests are likely to expand or retreat in the next hundred years or so; second, whether global warming is likely to intensify or attenuate fire regimes in these stands (I say \"intensify\", but this is a grossly unscientific opinion). I was about to do a third question but maybe I'd better stop before it's too late.)\n\nAgain, please let me know if there is another subreddit (r/borealforest??) where this question would be more appropriate (but do it in a nice way).

                "content": "Bit of a generalization but it  has to do with soil type, much of Northern Alberta was covered by a glacial lake at some point, and the soils have a high clay and silt content ideal conditions for mixed woods and pure Aspen stands . Disturbance and successional pathways have a part to play as well as Aspen can reproduce quickly after fire if the roots are left intact from suckering beating out the competition from grass, shrubs and other trees. These Aspen stands  can slowly transition to a Spruce dominated stand as the Aspen has a shorter lifespan and spruce will grow in the understory.  You will find Pines in drier, sandy soils where soil conditions are poorer and there is less competition.",

I live in Taos NM and we have a lot of the same trees just WAY further south, so I'm curious what same trees way different environment is like. If you don't have the means to get to Canada, just pop on over here and go around Colombine Hondo wilderness hiking and you can sample it :D.\n\nI haven't done a research study here, but my belief is that the change in growing season has really shook up the traditional succession model. Tradition says conifers > fire > aspen > conifers. That's based on N America areas with hardcore winters and super short growing seasons. Now with climate change the frost free days are increasing rapidly, and that's changing the calculus. Alberta probably easily has 1 more month of leaf time than it used to, and that changes the balance in favor of deciduous MASSIVELY. Why is Europe mostly deciduous? Longer growing seasons with wet summers. Even Siberia is a lot more deciduous than Canada - again I think it's a growing season / temp thing.",

The vast herds of bison etc of the past also likely made survival of various tree species that spread by seeds or acorns very challenging.

Alberta is more desert like.\n\nI have a couple partial quarters that a century ago had seen logging of conifers, fire and failed farming. (My family has been letting it naturalize.) Beyond the creek banks and lake shoreline the aspen have dominated the flat parkland areas. \n\nIn my life I\u2019ve seen really gross plagues of caterpillars strip kill off and set back the aspen but they are still manage to remain the dominate tree.\n\nThis article is interesting:\n\nGetting to the root of aspen survival | Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/agriculture-life-environment-sciences/news/2020/february/getting-to-the-root-of-aspen-survival.html",

Conifers other than jack pine need long fire free periods to reach sexual maturity (>20 years) that they may not get in areas along the prairie forest border. Soil types are generally not suitable for jack pine and very high frequency fires can eliminate jack pine.",

Historical fire cycles in the Boreal are 150-200 years. There is really no such thing as \"old-growth\" forest in the Boreal. Aspens are pretty available to burn in spring drought conditions before leaf out, especially if there are continuous grass fuels associated with the stands. The stands would recover quickly through sucker cloning but if the fire cycle or intensity increases without enough time for Aspens to reestablish you may see a transition to grass dominated plains due to loss of roots and stored suckering energy potential. Several major fires in the Northwest Territories and Northern Alberta burned through recent burn areas (less than 20 years old) in 2023, which is generally unheard of in the Boreal especially in the summer. Old burn areas are treated as fire breaks. These fires areas would likely be good indicators of how areas that have multiple high intensity fires affect the traditional succession and regeneration of Aspens.",

Otherwise spruce pine just smother them out. \n\nThat's why here all the north slopes are more conifer while aspen domimate the south faces.

He isn't interested in logging etc. He wants to do more preservation of wild areas and preventing fire/destruction.

I just know that OSU has a great program for remote sensing that somebody with a computer background would benefit from.\n\nI would say, however, that being in Idaho would likely present more opportunity to study fire and get more hands on experience with burning if that's what he's into. There is significantly more controlled fire applied in Northern Idaho versus Western Oregon. Plus, Moscow is great little college town.\n\nI would also add that both programs will (hopefully) emphasize the need for active management to meet the goals for landscape rehabilitation/restoration. In other words, logging may be the most effective tool available to address ecosystem goals. He should be willing to challenge his own biases.",

I also thought about really hauling ass and just getting as much internship expierence as possible and get an additional certification/Weiterbildung while doing my bachelors... Would that be enough to secure me work as a Forester?\n\nAnother point is that deadlines to apply for this years Ausbildung is gone. I can at earliest start an Ausbildung the end of 2026... What a bummer!\n\nDeutsch:  \nIch bin 33 Jahre alt, Deutscher/Amerikaner, und lebe seit 5 Jahren in Deutschland. Mein Deutsch ist B2/C1. Ich m\u00f6chte eine Karriere in der Forstwirtschaft anfangen, obwohl ich ein bisschen sp\u00e4t dran bin. Ich war auf der Suche nach einem Studium (nach einem Vorbereitungsjahr im Studienkolleg), aber jetzt \u00fcberlege ich, wie schwierig es sein k\u00f6nnte, mit einem Bachelor in Forstwirtschaft (auf Deutsch) Arbeit zu finden, wenn ich wenig praktische Erfahrung habe, abgesehen von ein paar Praktika. Macht es wirklich Sinn, 3 Jahre Ausbildung zu verbringen, noch 3 Jahre als Forstwirt zu arbeiten, um Erfahrung zu sammeln, und DANN noch 3 Jahre zu studieren? Ich denke, es w\u00fcrde mir Arbeit als Forstwirt mit 42 Jahren versprechen, aber ist das der beste Weg? Ich habe auch dar\u00fcber nachgedacht, richtig Gas zu geben und so viele Praktikumserfahrungen wie m\u00f6glich zu sammeln und gleichzeitig eine zus\u00e4tzliche Zertifizierung/Weiterbildung zu machen, w\u00e4hrend ich meinen Bachelor mache... W\u00fcrde das ausreichen, um mir Arbeit als Forstwirt zu sichern?\n\nEin anderes Punkt ist, dass die Fristen f\u00fcr die Bewerbung f\u00fcr diese Jahr Ausbildung schon vorbei sind. Ich kann fr\u00fchestens erst Ende 2026 eine Ausbildung anfangen... Was ein Pech!\n\nThanks so much for any advice. The past years have been rough, german bureaucracy is no joke, I've felt very  stuck and feel like I lost a lot of time jumping through hoops the past 5 years to get credits to study, which pretty much now have (no need to get into the full story, im just exhausted and need to find the right path).",

You will meet great people working in all kind of forestry areas - Freiburg has the national forestry research center with great climate change research, G\u00f6ttingen Arborism as a whole own BA and Eberswalde is the epicenter of modern ecological forestry management (way less conservative then the first two, c.f. Peter Wohlleben). They all collaborate closely with forestry service companies. I studied in Freiburg, then went off into agriculture, but my friends all got jobs either as tree climbers or serious forestry service work while the \u201cbrighter\u201d ones are still doing research. \n\nThe BA can be demanding, but if you stretch it over 4-5 years you enjoy study benefits and you while have plenty of time to do cheap license offered by the university (essentials like chainsaw certificates but also excursions putting you in touch with bigger companies). \n\nDepends where you aiming at with a forestry career - an Ausbildung will not catapult you into the line for a comfortable desk job like a BA will ;)",

                "content": "Article\n\n\n\n\"An independent federal agency has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to temporarily reinstate close to 6,000 employees fired since Feb. 13, finding reasonable grounds to believe the agency acted illegally in terminating them.\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) [issued a stay](https://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal%20Stays/Order%20on%20Stay%20Request%20(no%20cert%20plus%20errata).pdf), ordering USDA to return the fired workers to their jobs for 45 days while an investigation into the firings continues. The MSPB acts as an internal court to consider federal employees' complaints against the government.\n\nThe order, from board member Cathy Harris, covers probationary employees who received identical termination letters informing them that, based on their performance, they had not demonstrated that their further employment \"would be in the public interest.\"\n\nSince the middle of February, the Trump administration has fired tens of thousands of probationary employees across the federal government, typically those in their first or second year on the job.\n\nThe order comes in response to [a request from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal%20Stays/USDA%20Systemic%20Stay%20(redacted).pdf) (OSC), which is investigating the firings of probationary employees. It follows [a similar decision issued last week](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5307906/trump-probationary-employees-firing-mspb) that temporarily reinstated six probationary workers fired from six different agencies. Those employees are now back on the job at least through April 10, according to their lawyer, Michelle Bercovici.\n\nIn a statement, Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger urged all federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees, even without a direct order.\n\n\"Agencies are best positioned to determine the employees impacted by these mass terminations,\" Dellinger wrote. \"That's why I am calling on all federal agencies to voluntarily and immediately rescind any unlawful terminations of probationary employees.\"\n\n(The OSC, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by the government against federal employees and job applicants, is separate from the special counsels appointed by the Justice Department.)\n\n# Investigation of USDA led to request for a broad stay\n\nDellinger requested the broad stay for USDA employees last week after gaining a clear picture of how the firings of close to 6,000 people occurred.",

                "content": "\"Documents that OSC obtained and interviews that OSC conducted with USDA officials confirmed that USDA relied heavily on OPM guidance in terminating its probationary employees,\" he wrote, referring to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the agency that handles many human resource functions for the government.\n\nHe concluded that USDA did not take into consideration the performance or conduct of employees. Rather, he says, the department fired the workers after determining that their positions were not \"mission-critical,\" as OPM had instructed and using a template letter OPM provided.\n\n\"Whether USDA terminated each probationary employee therefore depended entirely on the nature of that employee's position, not on the adequacy of their performance or fitness for federal service,\" Dellinger wrote.\n\nTherefore, he wrote, USDA had improperly used the probationary status of employees to shrink the workforce, in order to circumvent procedures for mass layoffs, which include providing employees with 60 days' notice.\n\nAt the USDA and elsewhere, the Trump administration has begun that process, known as a reduction in force, as it seeks to shed large swaths of the federal workforce, even as legal challenges to its summary firings of probationary employees gain steam.\n\nThe exact number of USDA employees covered by Harris' order is unclear. In February, USDA told OSC it had fired 5,950 probationary employees. On Monday, the agency provided a list of only 5,692 names, according to the MSPB's order.\n\n\"OSC states that the agency cautioned that this number was still in flux due to corrections, rehirings, and changes to mission-critical designations,\" the order noted.\n\nBoth Dellinger and Harris themselves were fired by Trump only to be reinstated by courts in recent weeks, after judges found that they had been improperly removed.\n\nA separate challenge to the Trump administration's firing of probationary employees is advancing in federal court. Last week, [a federal judge in San Francisco ruled](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311445/federal-employees-firing-court-judge) that the mass firings likely violated multiple statutes. On Tuesday, [OPM revised a January memo](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5318039/fired-federal-employees-opm-memo) to federal agencies, noting that it was not directing them to take any personnel actions, and that decision-making authority was in their hands.An independent federal agency has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to temporarily reinstate close to 6,000 employees fired since Feb. 13, finding reasonable grounds to believe the agency acted illegally in terminating them.   The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued a stay, ordering USDA to return the fired workers to their jobs for 45 days   \nwhile an investigation into the firings continues. The MSPB acts as an internal court to consider federal employees' complaints against the government.",

Is she right?\nWe live on a fairly large property (+20 acres) in what was a semi rural area that's very quickly becoming surburbanized.  Our property is a mix of wetland, prairie and forest.  I've been planting tons of native tree species(~75 last year and an order for ~100 more this season) and really just love doing it.  \n\nMost of what I've been planting I've acquired directly through a regional tree farm at pretty steep discounts compared to what you'd pay for at the average nursery for trees of this size and caliper. Additionalluly ive been obtaining seedlings through our state nursery.   With that in mind, I've been floating the idea around of starting a tree farm with my wife and she's kinda written it off as just one of my crazy ideas. But, I think I actually wanna follow through with it.  \n\nI've founded businesses before (nothing agricultural though) so I'm more than capable of navigating the legal/administrative end of things.  My wife and I both work full time, but I WFH and have an incredibly flexible work schedule.   We're both high earners with no children, so any initial capital isn't an issue (actually the opposite, as we've been looking for new  investment opportunities due to income tax reasons).  It's not like we'd need to hit profitability immediately (or at all really) as we already have very stable income and plenty of savings. Really, I'm already doing all the work and spending the money to purchase trees to reforest the property anyway.   \n\nMature species already on the property to give an idea of the existing ecosystem:\n- Black walnut \n- white oak\n- shagbark hickory \n- Beach\n- Black locust \n- Various apple vars\n- Birch \n- White pine \n\n\nBesides the typical risks that come with starting any business, what are some specific things I should be conscientious of if I was to start a tree farm?  I don't really have aspirations to sell lumber, although I'd probably be open to wholesaling/retail trees as a nursery would  to help offset costs.  \n\n\n\n",

You typically have to kill more competing trees than you plant to make sure the ones you planted are the ones that grow. Forests are incredibly competitive growing environments. Only a small fraction of seedlings make it to maturity.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s really good you want to mimic the natural ecosystem and native forest compositions.\n\nHowever, the best way to do it is to let the first grow, and take out the species that are over-represented compared to the native forest composition.\n\nFor example, on my woodlot white spruce,balsam fir, grey birch, red maple, and poplar are dominant, but in the native old growth forest, it was red spruce, yellow birch, eastern white cedar, hemlock, and sugar maple, white pine, red pine, etc.\n\nSo what I do is when I cut something for my mill or firewood, I cut the l over-represented species, and leave room for the under-represented species to return.

I've completed my mining engineering diploma recently and the goal for me is to make it to mine management eventually. I've looked at 2 degree programs, the first being the mine management degree by Exeter university, they however after I reached out told me I need ATLEAST a couple years of experience in the industry but the degree program will be payed by my employer (makes sense as it is a degree apprenticeship). 2) The international mineral resources management degree is offered by dundee university and doesnt require previous work experience before enrolling into the degree program and since it offers this course up to a masters, I'd do the masters degree too. \n\nIt's obvious that the mine management degree will get you into mine management but can the same be said with an international mineral resources management degree? Or does the degree only get you into mineral extraction and processing management and you wouldn't be a mine manager? I am aware experience is an absolute MUST to get into management but wouldn't the degree in international mineral resources management be a solid foundation to get into management after a few years? Any input on this will be really appreciated",

                "content": "Not sure where you are but in Western Australia to be a mine manager you have to do at least 1 year of underground time on the tools (or surface but then you can\u2019t switch to underground). Then at least 10 years in a mining engineering position, I think in different areas now too (I got mine ages ago so it was different rules). Then you sit an online exam. You don\u2019t need a degree, once you have a degree manager jobs aren\u2019t that hard to get as many don\u2019t want them. I much prefer being technically than trying to get a bunch of grown adults to listen to you, and sorting out discipline and arguments and complaints about crap like camp food. \nWhy do you want to be a manager? Just get some work experience 2 more years of that is way better than a degree, if you need it in 5-10 years you can study part time and get your work to pay for it. Waste of time when yo I haven\u2019t even figured out if you enjoy engineering and working on mine sites.",

        "content": "Advice for a 22 yr old mining engineer student\nHey everyone, I'm a 22 yr old uni student graduating soon with a double degree in mining engineering and computer science. I know it's not the most conventional combination but I thought it'd be a good degree to have on the side as tech is (and forever will be) in demand. The whole reason for this post is because to be honest, I don't know where I am in life right now. I know I am young and that I should stay adventurous and try new things but at the same time I know I dont have all the time in the world and I don't want to dissapoint my parents that have sacrificed everything for my life. There's been a couple of things that have constantly been on my mind that I hope some experienced people here may be able to answer. I guess this post could also serve as one of those \"If I could go back in time, I would tell my younger self\" threads. \n\n* Addressing the elephant in the room, the FIFO lifestyle. I know it is definitely not easy and I went into this degree knowing that it's defs not for everyone. Fyi I was born and grew up in the heart of metropolitan sydney. However, my mindset was that I do not want to be another rat in the corporate rat race that will have me chained forever without ever achieving financial freedom. While I am young, with no kids and big responsibilities, I know FIFO wouldn't be too bad but obviously as someone who has grew up in the heart of sydney their whole life I'd by lying if I said I'm not worried about it at all. Some insight into the lifestyle, keeping relationships with your family/friends/girlfriend healthy and just some general tips for a young bloke like me would be hugely helpful. This also leads into my next point.\n* Career progressions to exit the FIFO lifestyle. Many people I have talked to and many video/reddit posts I have seen all seem to mention the phrase 'exit plan' which I completely agree is important especially later down the track when you want to settle down and have a family. If you could go back in time, what sort of exit plan would you give your younger self to truly optimise the time and effort spent doing this sort of work. Specifically for a mining engineer what sort of career routes would there be to go back into the city and be with family?\n* If there are any mining engineers reading this, what does a day in the life of a mining engineer look like. I have only ever done residential vacatoin work so I am still learning but from my experience, it seemed like long hours sitting in the site office, working on mine software etc. Any insight into what other things a mining engineer would normally do on site would be interesting to read.\n* And lastly, if anyone has any experience or knowledge they could share with regards to the uses of my computer science degree within the mining industry that would be awesome. Like mentioned, I am doing a double degree in computer science which may either be my exit plan or potentially even put up to good use within the mining industry. If anyone has any insights into this I am very interested.\n\nSorry for the long read and thanks for all advice guys. I am both worried and keen for whats to come in the future. ",

This merger would supposedly bring \u201cgreater profits\u201d for the companies and their investors.\u00a0\n\nBut, in 2018 Silver Run II was accused of hiding info about the actual financial situation and assets of Alta Mesa and Kingfisher.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0When this news came out, $AMR dropped, and investors filed a lawsuit.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that $AMR settled $126M with investors and they\u2019re accepting claims.   \n  \n\n\nSo here is a little FAQ for this settlement:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQ. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?\n\nA. No, if you have purchased $AMR during the class period, you are eligible to participate.\n\n\n\nQ. How much money do I get per share?\n\nA. The estimated payout is $2.72 per share, but the final amount will depend on how many shareholders file claims.\n\n\n\nQ. Who can claim this settlement?\n\nA. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $AMR between August 16, 2017, and May 17, 2019.\n\n\n\nQ. How long does the payout process take?\n\nA. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.\n\n\n\nYou can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11thestate.com/cases/altamesa-investor-settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/altamesa-investor-settlement)\u00a0",

I\u2019m half way through a bio degree that I\u2019m not super hyped about as I have to travel for 2 hours (each way) to get to uni each week and I\u2019ve put it on pause to do something else with my life. Most of the reason why I am trying to change degrees is the travel time and the lack of jobs in the bio field as well as the non-existent pay.\n\nI work \u201cfull time casual\u201d at my job and they support me doing schooling so I can take days off given reasonable notice. I\u2019m a CMMS coordinator (I.e. the maintenance coordinators and facilities managers admin assistant). I\u2019m hoping to start a civil engineering degree next semester using credits from my bio course to potentially skip all the electives meaning I can potentially finish the degree in 4 years at a part time load.\n\nDuring civil engineering I hope to kinda do the average amount of work. I don\u2019t want to overly succeed as with working 4 days a week and 2 subjects at uni I\u2019ll burn myself out. I want to try my best at a sustainable rate which seems to be 65-80 marks. During the civil engineering degree I hope to do some internships and get some experience under my belt (any recommendations for east vic or online companies would be awesome).\n\nPost civil engineering I hope to do mining engineering FIFO from another major city. If that means I have to move there that sucks but it\u2019s possible but I\u2019m hoping I can fly myself there and then FIFO out of the city every other week. I\u2019m going civil engineering as I heard that mining companies will take civil engineers as they are desperate. I also thought that if mining doesn\u2019t want me at least I am still well equipped to be a civil engineer which is a great career in itself!\n\nDo you guys have any advice to help close the gap between civil engineering and mining?\n\nIs there anything else I can do during my degree that would aid in getting a job as a mining engineer?\n\nIf there anything in Melbourne that I can do to network and make connections with some other great Aussies in mining?\n\nThanks, I look forward to hearing your responses.",

I understand degrees have electives but surely there'll be a limit on the number of first year units that they'll recognise.\n\nThe \"Mining companies are desperate so they'll take civil engineers\" is sort of a relic of the past. Most companies are able to secure enough mining engineers these days. Obviously there are exceptions but typically you need a mining degree, especially for underground mines, and there is lots of competition as is for working on open pit mines. You can sort of sway their opinion by doing mining relevant electives in your civil degree however based on what you're saying you're planning on getting those waived so that ain't really an option. Definitely join relevant clubs like the AusIMM local chapter for Victoria and apply for mining relevant internships or even geotechnical engineering roles. \n\nHope this helps.",

Following this news, the stock fell significantly, and ReconAfrica faced a lawsuit from shareholders.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that the company already settled $5M with Canadian investors, and they\u2019re still accepting late claims.\n\n\n\nSo here is a little FAQ for this settlement:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQ. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?\n\nA. No, if you purchased $RECO.V during the class period, you are eligible to file a claim.  \n  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQ. Who can claim this settlement?\n\nA. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $RECO.V between May 30, 2020, and September 07, 2021, inclusive.  \n  \n\n\n\n\nQ. How long does the payout process take?\n\nA. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.\n\n\n\nYou can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11thestate.com/cases/reconafricacanada-investor-settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/reconafricacanada-investor-settlement)\u00a0\n\n",

Mining engineer would have more upward potential in the long term if you want to stay in mining. But way less flexibility in terms of where you can work, you are kind of stuck in mining or mining adjacent companies for the most part. I would say learning a trade is your best option here, because it gives you the opportunity to work at a mine, but you can still easily get into any other industries.\n\nI only say this because as someone who has worked FIFO, I really don't think it's for everyone. Imagine doing a 4 year degree to become a mine engineer then realizing FIFO sucks balls, it would be kind of a waste of your time and money. Sure there's non FIFO mines in Canada and elsewhere but it seems like you are attracted to the FIFO aspect, not the mining part.",

I have seen some apprentices get hired but this is typically reserved for natives.\n\nSo you may need to start in residential or commercial before moving up.\n\n\n\nTechnical Roles:\n\nThis involves college technical training which is generally two years in length, you can get into technical/office roles which can include Mine Surveying, Mine Planning, Mine Ventilation, or Mine OPs.\n\n\nProfessional roles:\n\nThis involves university level education that is usually 4 years in length, usually geology and mining engineering degrees are the most common and most likely to gain employment in mining but I have seen civil engineering, chemistry and environmental engineering majors get in aswell.\n\nThese roles tends to have the best career prospections, if corporate is something you\u2019re interested in.",

        "content": "$300 heating bill in South Carolina 600sq ft house - is this normal???\nMy husband and I rent in Columbia sc and have had a ton of problems with the house we rent. The stove was filling with propane and not starting, condensation causing paint bubbling, can see through the seams of the doors, mold, etc. \n\nRight now we\u2019re STRUGGLING because we live in a very mild climate (60\u00b0 winters) and our heating bill is $300. We keep the house at 65 at night and 70-72 in the day but we turn the heat off when we leave for work. We also turn off the heat as much as we can since it\u2019s 70-80 for a lot of the time. This feels insane because we\u2019re doing so much to bring our bill down but it\u2019s still so high.\n\nWe don\u2019t do much during peak hours because we know that jacks up the price, but what we\u2019re paying seems crazy? Is it crazy or is this normal? \n\nWe really want to leave the house asap but our lease ends in May. \n\nWe have dominion energy if that means anything. ",

        "content": "Enbridge gas help edit\nOkay, I am utterly confused and needing some assistance. Enbridge is closed today otherwise I\u2019d call them!!\n\nWe moved into a new place last month and used 695m3 of gas\u2014 no idea how. The meter reading on last months bill was: \n\n49053\n\nAnd we paid 356$ for that. \nShocked at that price, considering I used to live in a 3 bed townhome with 3 adults and a teenager and never paid close to that amount, my landlord advised closing vents, keeping temp down, etc.\n\nSo we have been maintaining temp at 17 degrees overnight and 20 during the days. We\u2019re in Ontario and the shits COLD mind you. We are likely running up our hydro bill just keeping the electric fireplace on. Anyways, recently I checked the meter and it now reads:\n\n55141 \n\nSo it went from last month at 49053 to 55141 in like, less than a month. Here is where I need help\u2014 in calculating the cubic meters of gas used, I subtract 55151-49053 (right??) and get 6048. Does that mean I\u2019ve used 6, 048 m3 of gas in like 3 weeks? And if so, HOW is that even possible? Or am I reading this totally wrong? I am terrified I\u2019m going to get like a 2000$ + gas bill next month. \n\nI had the furnace guy come and check our furnace and water heater, both of which work fine. We switched our thermostat to a newer model. We are currently in the process of putting film on our windows. \n\nIt is an older house, the landlord said he is going to reinsulate the roof in the spring, but still\u2014 something is just not adding up.\n\nSomeone knowledgeable please help me understand!!

        "content": "Water bill is incredibly high and somethings fishy\nWe recently leased a 2br condo in a building in LA. There's an individual property management company that manages our unit and liaisons with the property management company that covers the entire building and the HOA. They informed us that we'd be responsible for all utilities which is fine as we were at our last unit as well. I transitioned our LADWP (which covered power, water, sewer, and trash at our last building) and SoCal Gas. I received our first LADWP bill of $200 for two months (which sounded reasonable). What I didn't realize is that that was only a power charge, not including water. \n\nOur property management company emailed us in December informing us that the water bill is actually billed separately through RealPage Utilities Management (yes, THAT RealPage. The one being sued by the DOJ for artificially inflating rents with an algorithm), that the HOA/property manager set this up and it's how water is handled, the owners had been billed $420 for our water usage since moving in at the end of August and we needed to pay that, and set us up with a RealPage account for it to be billed directly to us. The bill lists two charges: water usage, and \"energy to heat water\" which is at a much higher rate. So instead of being charged for our water usage alone and the energy usage being rolled into our electricity or gas, we're basically being charged a higher rate to use our water heater which I'm certain is also going toward our electric bill. I called RealPage and they said these readings are coming from submeters of which there are two, one tracking water and one tracking energy to heat water. They're based on readings from LADWP that then get transmitted electronically to them. The HOA/management company decided on this, we aren't being billed for anything but our own consumption (there's a pool/hot tub in the building but they say we aren't paying for that.)\n\nSorry for the long explanation but I wanted to give all the context. At our previous apartment (3br, 3 roommates vs two now) our water bill would be about $120/2 months so about $60 a month for 3 people. We have since received two more bills from RealPage- $197 for November usage and $201 for December usage. Not only does this seem excessively high compared to our last apartment where there was an entire other human being using hot water, there's another catch. I was gone for 10 days in December and my roommate was gone for a week. How could our bill not only have not gone down, but actually gone UP? What are my options for finding how they are billing me, if these meters are accurate, if they might be stealing from/overcharging us? \n\nRealpage said we needed to ask for an inspection from the HOA/Management company to find any leaks or to ask if the meters can be checked. Should I also call LADWP and see if they can give me readings for the past couple months on what our billing should've been?\n\nThis feels incredibly fishy and like someone in this is making a ton of money off of us illegally. Any help is much appreciated. If this isn't the right place for this post please let me know where I should post it. \n\n  \n",

                "content": "Well this sucks. There's a lot going on here, so let try and explain a bit and also ask some questions.\n\nYes, RealPage is acting as a submetering company. They get the water bill from LADWP and then resell the water back to you with a markup to cover their cost for administering the submeters and also splitting out any common water features on the property. This is a common but crappy business model. LADWP may only have one meter going to the property for all the units to share. The submetering company installs meters at each unit, reads those meters, maintains them and the pipes going from the master meter to the submeter, and then provide all the billing, payments, and customer service on behalf of the property owner.\n\nIt sounds like LADWP may actually read your submeters and submit them to RealPage, which is dumb, but also makes sense. If they install the same meters with the same transmitters as the master meter, then RealPage doesn't have to send a person out to read the meters manually and can just pay a fee to LADWP to read their submeters for them. Probably cheaper than paying for a part-time meter reader.\n\nSee if you can find where the water pipes are coming into your unit and see if you can trace it back to the water meters themselves. It sounds like you have a cold and hot water line, at least that's what you are getting billed for. But you also said that you have a hot water heater in the unit? Can you double check all of that? If you can access the actual meters for your unit, then you can probably find the dials on there for the readings. You can do some testing and confirming by reading the meters at night and then in the morning where you should have nearly no usage (maybe an ice maker or toilet flush but minimal) and then read them again after a few showers, dishes, and laundry and see how they compare.\n\nRegardless, the rates are set and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. Unless they are reading the wrong meters or applying a conversion factor for your unit if they are feeding multiple units with one meter, then the usage is what it is. \n\nHere's what I would do:\n\nConfirm that you have hot and cold water coming to you from the meters and that you don't have a personal hot water heater in the unit.\n\nLook at the bill from RealPage or on their website and determine their rate schedule (probably a base charge, a flat admin fee, and then consumption/usage fees based on your meter readings) and then compare their rate schedule with your bills to make sure they are calculated correctly.\n\nIf you find out either that your unit isn't getting the hot water your being billed for from RealPage, or that your calculated charges don't add up, or that you are being charged for usage on your meter that isn't really there - then something is seriously wrong and you should get more involved with the utility, state regulators, and RealPage to resolve the issue.",

I know its NOT Entergy's fault but would it be unlawful for them to keep all that money?

My Parents Are Being Charged \u00a3118/Month by Affinity Water in a 2-Bed House \u2013 What Can We Do?\n\nI\u2019m reaching out on behalf of my parents who are facing an incredibly high water bill from Affinity Water, and I'm hoping someone here might have advice or has dealt with something similar.\n\n- My parents live in a small 2-bedroom house, and there are just 3 people living there.\n\n- Previously, they didn\u2019t have a dishwasher, so they had to hand-wash dishes, and there was a dripping tap, but nothing too extreme in terms of water usage.\n\n- Recently, Affinity Water averaged out their water usage based on the meter (which wasn\u2019t even active until now) and claimed it was equivalent to 9 people living in the house! Clearly, this is ridiculous.\n\n- They\u2019re now being charged \u00a3118 per month! Before this metering started, they were paying around \u00a325-30 per month, which seems far more reasonable.\n\nFor Context:\n\n- My girlfriend and I live in a flat, and we likely use a similar amount of water as my parents. We take two showers a day and wash some dishes as well. Yet, we pay about \u00a328 per month. This makes the \u00a3118 per month my parents are being charged even more unbelievable.\n\nWhat We've Done:\n\n- I emailed Affinity Water back in June asking for someone to come and inspect the situation, but they ignored the request. I followed up in August\u2014still no response.\n\n- I finally spoke with someone who suggested that maybe the dishwasher (which they didn\u2019t even have for the past two years) could be the cause, but even then, that wouldn\u2019t explain the equivalent of 9 people using water.\n\n- I\u2019ve also reached out to them on Twitter (X), hoping for a quicker response.\n\nThe Issue:\n\n- We don\u2019t even know where the meter is because my parents never needed to know before this. If anyone knows how to locate and read the water meter, that would be really helpful as we\u2019re not sure where it is and have never needed to check it before.\n\n- My parents are very water-conscious, taking short showers, using water-efficient appliances, and never leaving taps running unnecessarily. This is why a bill equivalent to 9 people\u2019s usage seems outrageous.\n\n- Affinity Water is seemingly ignoring our requests for an efficiency check, and I feel like they\u2019re taking advantage of the situation by delaying or ignoring us.\n\n- My parents are on a low income\u2014my dad has just started his pension, and my mum will be next year. They\u2019ve never qualified for Universal Credit because my mum has been frugal and saved over the years, but now it feels like they\u2019re being penalised for it.\n- This sudden spike in their bill is putting a significant financial strain on them, especially as they\u2019re both approaching retirement and living on a fixed income.\n\nWhat We Need:\n\n- Has anyone else experienced this kind of issue with Affinity Water or another water company? How did you resolve it?\n\n- Is there any advice on what steps we can take to challenge this extortionate bill?\n\n- Should we escalate this to a higher authority, like the Consumer Council for Water, or are there other avenues we should explore?\n\n- Also, if anyone has experience with consumer rights or legal advice on how to challenge a utility company effectively, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis \u00a3118/month bill is a massive hit on my parents, and I feel awful that it\u2019s taken so long to address this, but I don\u2019t live with them and have to handle all their admin. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you so much for reading and for any guidance you can offer.\n",

I decided to leave the state because it too expensive to live there and it was hard for me to get a decent job. I\u2019ve moved to North Carolina in October 2021. My dad convinced me to keep the FPL account under my name and he\u2019ll continue to make payments. He was making the payments until last month. He decided to create a new account and now I\u2019m stuck with a $387.73 bill that I have to pay by September, he\u2019s still leaving at the address. I tried to reason with him and I got hit with the \u201cafter all I\u2019ve done for you\u201d nonsense. If I call FPL and provide them proof that I haven\u2019t lived in the address since 2021, would they transfer the bill to his name? I\u2019m very upset because, I\u2019ve always supported him financially. He didn\u2019t want to come with to North Carolina because of the cold weather in winter. Not always but there are times when I had to pay rent in both states. I\u2019ve always been there for him even when he wasn\u2019t there for me when I needed him.\nPlease help, any suggestions or tips on how to get out of this situation would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you.

The same ones we have had since 2000.\n\nMy mums friend told her that when a tenancy is terminated everything gets transferred back to the landlord including the utilities and when the tenancy is renewed the landlord should transfer the utilities back over to the new tenant. So when my mum had to reapply for the tenancy, jigsaw homes (our landlord) didn\u2019t transfer the utilities back over. My mum rang jigsaw homes and they asked her to bring the tenancy agreement and the SSE OVO letter that has their account number in to them. They then rang a few days later still confused and told my mum to ring SSE and ask for an account number. My mum rang SSE and they put her through to a different department. My mum was on hold for almost two hours and they hung up. My mum is going to try again soon.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what to do or if what we\u2019re doing is right. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone on here does. Thanks.",

The thing is, As you can see from the picture, it's the top of a 6-meter column from a chimney that's underneath it. When I did it, I didn't think heat would be a problem.

        "content": "Sub-Contractor Cash Flow Issues with AIA Billing\nHey All,\n\nI run a millwork shop that handles fabrication and installation of Architectural Millwork for Commercial projects. We started building our sales pipeline in April of 24 and ramped up operations in July of 24, achieving roughly 597k in revenue (accrual basis) for 2024. \n\nAs we grow this year, I\u2019m trying to have an organized approach to stay ahead of the cash flow on projects. We currently have a little under 400k under contract, all in tenant improvement/spec suites.  The jobs span from 10-16 week timelines and they all use AIA billing. From a sub standpoint, I\u2019ve been finding it difficult to stay ahead of cash flow and we end up getting uncomfortably close to breaking the bank. \n\nWe end up submitting our 1st pay app as soon as we\u2019re able to and bill for 100% materials and 25% of admin for submittal drawings and whatnot. So I\u2019m expecting our first payment in roughly 55 days, which leaves us with a 25 day gap when ordering materials on net30. Do any of y\u2019all finance material purchases during the 25 day gap or do you wait until your payment from the GC lines up with your net30 payments?\n\nJust spitballing a solution on my notepad, I figure if we submit our initial pay app on January 15th or 20th, I\u2019ll wait until the 20th of the following month to order materials so that when our payment rolls around on 3/15, I\u2019ll have 5 days for it to clear before issuing payments to vendors. It looks good on paper, but obviously there will be special cases like quick turn projects and COD or long lead materials.\n\nAny cash flow management tips would be welcomed, especially for a young growing business.",

I\u2019ve been applying for jobs in various fields, mostly in welding and construction labor, but I haven\u2019t been getting any callbacks or responses. I\u2019m feeling stuck and unsure of what to do next.  \n\nDoes anyone have advice or recommendations for someone in my situation? Any tips on job searching, networking, or alternative opportunities would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nThanks in advance!",

That's why every tax cut is a cut for the rich, because the rich are the only ones who pay taxes. \n\nWhen you factor in tax transfers, the \"poors\" pay a [negative effective tax rate](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs_2x/public/2021-10/treasury%20tax%20rates.png?itok=q8HJhgzg) since they're getting more back in benefits than they pay in taxes. So I don't know where you get the idea that the poor are being fleeced. If everyone paid their fair share, we'd have a flat tax system which would result in the poor paying far more and the rich paying far less.\n\n>When it comes to federal taxes, that funds things like the military, subsidizing industries etc rather than actually paying for your localized infrastructure in many places\n\nWhy would the federal government need to be involved in local infrastructure? That's a violation of the [10th amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-10/). The interstate system was developed as a way to move military equipment quickly across the country, so there's [some justification there](https://alu.army.mil/alog/2018/MARAPR18/PDF/198095.pdf). But now that it's been constructed, the states should be the ones overseeing ongoing maintenance, perhaps with a small federal agency overseeing that they're being maintained to federal standards. But local roads? State highways? Not something the federal government should be involved with.\n\n>most small communities would be impossible to keep on the grid and sewer and water service lines otherwise.\n\nOkay. I don't see this as a problem. Plenty of people alive today who can tell you about life before electricity and indoor plumbing. Somehow people survived. And if they can't fund it themselves, or if that community prefers life without utilities, [so be it](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/zyrocz/til_that_the_amish_can_and_do_use_electricity/). Where I spent most of my growing up years, we didn't have sewer. We had a septic tank, like savages!\n\nWe can see from \"highly advanced\" California that the government being in charge of utilities doesn't guarantee competence or effectiveness. [Their electric utility set fires](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/pacific-gas-electric-settlement-dixie-fire-california/index.html#:~:text=And%20in%202020%2C%20PG%26E%20pleaded,and%20destroying%20thousands%20of%20structures) because they don't maintain the system properly. Their fire chief failed to ensure the hydrant system would [actually have water](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html) to put out fires. And California is among the [highest taxes](https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/2024/12/01/how-the-50-states-rank-by-tax-burden/103495/) in the nation. I'd prefer to live somewhere I'm left alone instead of using a long list of excuses like you have for why I need to pay more taxes - only to have them not go to the things they're supposed to. Or well-connected individuals overbid what it should cost and give a kickback to the bureaucrat in charge of approving public works contracts.\n\n# And none of this has anything to do with my position that property taxes should be eliminated",

This includes detailed specifications, quality standards, and delivery timelines.\n* **Regular Monitoring:**\u00a0Maintain open communication and proactively monitor progress throughout the production process.\n* **Solid Contracts:**\u00a0Invest in a comprehensive contract that outlines responsibilities, payment terms, intellectual property protection, dispute resolution mechanisms, and quality guarantees. Get legal advice to ensure it's enforceable in the relevant jurisdiction.\n* **Visit in Person:**\u00a0If feasible, visiting the manufacturing facility can provide valuable insights and build rapport.\n\nFocusing on these practical steps to build confidence and secure your interests will lead to a more successful and reliable partnership, regardless of location.\n\nBy the way, I am a China-based manufacturer.

The standard MO is to get paid for manufacture, but once the product becomes established they just start selling the exact same thing for cheap on amazon, tank your business then launch a very similar looking brand. If you report the seller and somehow get the listing taken down, you will find yourself playing whack-a-mole when they re-list the exact same thing under a new \"brand\" five mins later. \n\nUltimately violations of intellectual property are in many ways, normalized in China, and the factory owners have local connections that make it almost impossible for a foreigner to take legal recourse.\n\nI highly recommend hiring a local facilitator to keep an eye on the ground.  \n\nBest of luck!",

Think about the numbers \u2013 they pitch 1000 potential clients a year, they have many chances to find out what instills confidence. If they haven\u2019t figured it out yet, it\u2019s because they haven\u2019t hired the right sales people \u2013 which is a caution flag about manufacturing maybe not having the right people either, but the reverse isn\u2019t a safe assumption.\n\nYou asked for people\u2019s experience. This is it. It isn\u2019t a politically charged, bumper-sticker based set of talking points about \u2018you can\u2019t trust any foreigner!\u2019 - this is people who\u2019ve literally lived through this situation. \n\nThey are trying to warn you that you are considering working with a completely different culture, in a completely different industrial context. All the rules are different. \n\nYou effectively have no enforcement capabilities in the country, and are a small fish with no economic leverage. If you are being honest with yourself, you have to plan as if all these \u2018worst case\u2019 scenarios do come to pass.\n\nYou plan to spend big on advertising \u2013 so you\u2019re building the market that you\u2019ll both be selling into. But by the end of your ad campaign, will you have amortized your tooling? Because they could be running off their products using your tooling also\u2026 so, like marketing, tooling and infrastructure isn\u2019t a cost they will have to pay when they notice that there is a market for these things\u2026 \n\nCan you compete with that? Do you have a value add service, adjacent technology, or market relationship that makes your brand name widget a distinctly different, and better, choice?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to ruin your sleep, but if you have a better\u2026 \u2018can opener\u2019 and make it elsewhere, a knockoff will *eventually* show up on Ali-Express. If you give a Chinese company the plans for your can opener, your need to assume your IP will be more faithfully copied just that much sooner. The higher your technical innovation is above can-opener/appliance/commodity level, the more lead time you are giving up, IMHO.",

Now, with the disclaimer out, here's my 2 cents:\n\nYou are not going to build up domestic manufacturing in 4 years. That is a 40-50 year project, and that involves importing among other things, skill. Which you are driving out of the country right now. I'm specifically talking with my industry (textiles) in mind here, but it should apply to other industries too.\n\n1) Manufacturing sometimes requires an entire ecosystem. One company setting up a plant is pointless if they can't do 4 operations which cannot be done at scale. Full vertical integration is simply not possible (at least, not economically viable) in some cases. This is just an example, but if you are making jeans, you need somebody to sell you rivets, because jeans cannot be made without rivets. You cannot set up a rivet making unit because it is a whole other industry for which all of the points in this essay apply and you don't really have customers for that unit aside from yourself. Also, your jeans making unit only needs 0.001% of the output of your rivet making unit. All of this is not a problem when an industrial ecosystem already exists.\n\n2) Manpower is a huge issue when setting up full supply chains. Manpower in my country is cheap. Like $0.5/hr for unskilled work and up to $1.5/hr for skilled work. Factory managers earn like $600-700 per month and that is a really good salary. And we struggle to compete with other countries because manpower is cheaper there. You cannot tariff us enough to make $15/hr competitive. My company will be affected by these tariffs if only because my US customers will be looking at cheaper options than what I can afford to give.\n\nAll in all, not a good idea. Especially for your country, but also for everyone else trading with you.",

It manufactures more than the next 4 giants combined (Japan, Germany, South Korea, India). The only country that manufactures more is China which has 5x population and its focus is manufacturing. It is a nonsense that US does not manufacture. What it does not have is manufacturing jobs. A lot of things was automated.\n\nThis is the choice. We try to get the jobs back and in the process we destroy the economy. The jobs are not coming back, the future is automated manufacturing. USA has low unemployment and there are simply no people who would do these jobs anyway.\n\nWhat USA did was move to high paying service jobs. When people hear service they think cleaning and mcdonalds but it is actually software, electronics, design, finance and many others. Stuff gets designed in US and manufactured in other places. This makes US wealthy.\n\nWe need to embrace more of the latter and less of the former if we want to continue to prosper.\n\nAs a fun state If I recall it correctly that from the actual value of Iphone \\~ 4% of that is assembly. So when phone is assembled in China, only 4% of the value is actually spent there. When I heard that for the first time I found that pretty surprising.",

No country is entirely self-sufficient; all rely on trade for essential goods and materials they cannot produce efficiently.\n\nThe U.S. imports two-thirds of its aluminum due to a lack of infrastructure\u2014a problem worsened by past policy decisions, high energy costs, and environmental regulations. Rebuilding this capability would take decades, requiring skilled labor, new facilities, and massive investment. Even then, some resources other than aluminum are simply unavailable domestically, making full independence impossible.\n\nTariffs are a tax on consumers, meant to push companies toward domestic suppliers by making imports more expensive. But when domestic supply can\u2019t meet demand, costs rise further due to labor shortages and infrastructure expansion. Eventually, domestic prices climb so high that even with tariffs, imports become the cheaper option again\u2014leaving consumers paying more either way.\n\nIn the short term, some domestic companies may see higher revenue, but the gains won\u2019t last. Increased costs for materials and labor, plus the expense of scaling production, will eat into profits. When prices rise too much, consumer demand drops, forcing companies to cut costs\u2014often through layoffs\u2014or lobby for tariff reductions to restore cheaper imports. In the end, protectionism collapses under its own weight, leaving both businesses and consumers worse off.\n\nAnd on top of all this, we\u2019re pissing on every single one of our allies. Every. Single. One. Reckless tariff policies have turned trusted trade partners into adversaries, damaging relationships that took generations to build.

This directly contributes to what you mention about wages being too high while simultaneously defending actions which will cause that exact thing to occur.\n\nIf you want an actual solution look no further than what Japan's government did after the wars. They heavily funded quality control research and education and brought in manufacturers to learn those things. They completely turned around their industrial sector by funding research and education and improving competitiveness. They led the world in manufacturing for decades because of that. Why aren't we doing that?",

I\u2019m a director or product development and I\u2019ve been working in consumer product design and engineering for over 20 years.

What is your operating schedule, are you at 24 hrs? Is this uptick short term or do you expect it to sustain?\n\n\nIf you are labor constrained, I would start with identifying easily trainable low risk tasks and get a few solid temp workers (Everyone just lold at that statement because it will be a challenge) and train them on those tasks first. You can build their experience with other tasks as they master and convert to full time if the demand sustains.  This also will give you time to look at process mapping and efficiency improvement to gauge if you need permanent headcount expansion and how much. Say you make cutting boards or something. Yeah you can\u2019t train someone quickly to use every tool and know every pattern and cnc routing. But if you have a single piece flow, you can move to batching. A temp could cut blanks, sand the boards, packaging final products, etc while your skilled labor handles routing, finishing, machine setup, inspection, etc.  Keep your experience working where it\u2019s needed and get hands for stuff you can train within a week.\n\nIf you are machine hour constrained. Your options are more machines/tools/workstations or more operating hours. This means adding a second or third shift depending on your current operating hours. Alternatively you can add more stuff/machines but you are space constrained. If you want to take this route, you may look at offsite storage. You could for example store raw materials at a third party warehouse with a weekly transfer so you only carry what you need in your production space. You can do the same with finished goods distribution.\n\nAll of these options will cost money but that\u2019s ok. I would just avoid the classic scale mistake of hiring a lot of people really fast, that\u2019s how you end up with layoffs and a cultural hit. With temps or contracts there\u2019s an understanding of what that means and they don\u2019t expect to stay forever.",

The last time a customer insisted on sending us a used mold, not only did they have to pay the VAT on the original cost of the mold (which was 10 years old by that point) they also had to spend $3k on a lawyer to \"facilitate\" the approval. Whole process took about 3-4 months from the time it arrived in Shanghai. So they also had to pay storage fees for all that time as well as the original shipping costs and other minor charges. In the end, they ended up spending significantly more than the mold was worth... which is what I had warned them about from the beginning.\n\nThere's more that I'm not going to write on a public forum but I strongly suggest against shipping any tools, molds or other used equipment to China.",

                "content": "There are a lot of sources about root cause analysis, but instead of just reading, I would recommend getting some good training on it. I can\u2019t fully explain what to do and how to do it in a few paragraphs, but I can share a structured methodology for quality problems, especially in manufacturing industries.\n\nI assume that there is a well-defined problem with all the details (5W2H is a good methodology for defining a problem).\n\n# 1) Fishbone Analysis \u2013 Identifying Potential Causes in Brainstorming\n\nYou should identify potential causes with a team that knows the relevant process well. The team should think openly and generate ideas about what could be causing the problem.  \nFor example:\n\n* Machine parameters have variations\n* Tooling wear or deformation\n* No control in place for the failure mode\n* Operators were not trained\n\nAt this stage, you don\u2019t know exactly what happened. You are just listing ideas that will need to be investigated in the next step (FTA).\n\n# 2) Fault Tree Analysis \u2013 Verifying the Potential Causes from Fishbone\n\nHere, you verify the causes identified in the Fishbone Analysis. Since brainstorming includes all possible ideas, FTA helps you systematically filter and confirm whether they are actual causes of the problem.\n\nThe main logic behind FTA is comparing good and bad parts (or good and bad statuses) by referring to standard requirements. That\u2019s why I see FTA as the most significant part of root cause analysis.\n\nAfter this comparison, you will have verified causes, meaning the causes directly linked to the problem. However, you still don\u2019t know the root cause yet\u2014just the contributing causes.\n\n# 3) 5Why Root Cause Analysis \u2013 Deep Diving into the Origin of the Problem\n\nNow, you take the verified causes from FTA and apply **5Why analysis**. You start by asking \u201cWhy?\u201d against each verified cause to trace the issue back to its root.\n\nThere are numerous sources and examples about 5Why since it\u2019s one of the most commonly used root cause techniques in problem-solving. I\u2019d like to give an example to better explain the link between these methods, but even a simple example would take quite a lot of space here. So, I highly recommend you to look into these methods further and getting professional training. It can be a bit costly, but it\u2019s extremely useful. Additionally, I\u2019d suggest **8D training**, which covers all problem-solving steps rather than just root cause analysis.\n\nI\u2019m still working on my root cause analysis and corrective actions training on Udemy, so I can\u2019t share it yet. But [here\u2019s an article](https://metekilic.com/2025/02/08/technical-systemic-root-cause-corrective-preventive-action-whats-the-difference/) about the logic of 5why, corrective actions, and preventive actions.\n\nBy the way, feel free to ask any questions about **problem-solving and quality management systems**. I wish you success with your company\u2019s ISO 9001 certification!",

It\u2019s a commonly used term in manufacturing and beyond. But what exactly is Quality Control? And how is it different from a Quality Audits?\n\n**Quality Control** is all about making sure that every product meets the expected standards. We check parts, test systems, and add multiple layers of verification to ensure nothing slips through. Even automated systems and robots make mistakes, so control mechanisms are there to catch them. Sometimes, we even test the testers by using trap parts to verify that sensors or cameras are still doing their job.\n\n**Quality Audits**, on the other hand, don\u2019t focus on individual products. They look at the bigger picture: Is the entire system working as it should? Instead of checking every part, an audit takes a snapshot of the organization\u2019s processes, documentation, training records, and quality management system. Think of it like VDA 6.3 or IATF 16949 audits\u2014it\u2019s not about catching defects but making sure the whole system is in good health.\n\nSo while Quality Control keeps production in check, Quality Audits evaluate whether both production and control mechanisms are working effectively.\n\nI found this distinction a bit interesting and wrote about it in more detail elsewhere.

Quality control can describe a group or department who works to ensure that parts being produced match the customers requirements. Of course it can also be the system that is put in place to ensure that those products meet their specs.\n\nSame for quality audits. I can't speak for everyone but in my experience, a quality audit is only referring to auditing for compliance to a quality standard. The goal isn't necessarily to ensure the company is healthy/successful but highlight any gaps between the quality standard and the day to day processes. This is a pretty big distinction.\n\nCompany health and overall success is more related to things like OpEx and executive strategy. Of course that all goes out the window based on the specific company in question and how they choose to describe it.",

He shared this information in a webinar hosted and moderated by James Roche, A&D practice director for CIMdata, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based global strategic management consulting and research company focused on Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).\n\nBarr\u00e9 said that by mid-2026, The Common Language project is expected to be ready for application at scale. The language will offer OEMs beyond A&D with easy paths for people and machines to clarify, federate and pose questions to blocks of data.\n\n\u201cPrior to the development of this common language, OEMs have spent tens of thousands of hours searching for data without a Rosetta stone to navigate terminology and definitions. Point-to-point mapping across hundreds of IT applications must be updated each time an application is added or modified. The [way] to overcome this obstacle is to create a standard\u2014which is a consensus by nature\u2014with key players of the domain. [This is] then available for application within aircraft programs as needed,\u201d said Barr\u00e9.\n\nThe language is built on International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 81346, a series of international standards originally developed for construction projects like buildings.",

I am currently trying to import some raw coffee beans from Vietnam and have provided all necessary documents to the customs broker who is helping us with the process.

Researching online, it seems like there is no standard for this certificate at all and these third party companies are just doing it as a money grab.  \n\nI tried to get more information from the broker to see who they recommend I can use and if they can provide me with an example of what the document actually looks like, but they aren't really giving me any details or leads, just one company they recommended that their other customers used was Registrar Corp. I contacted Registrar Corp and they charge a whopping $395 for this certificate! I did call other companies that provide this \"certificate\" and they charge around $150-$190, which is a lot more reasonable. \n\nIs this document actually needed? Or is my broker making some money off of me paying for this extra certificate? Would the cheaper alternatives work as well? They did say that Customs has cleared the package but still on an FDA hold, which seems to be expected since this is a new product that hasn't been imported before from Vietnam. Not sure if they can hold my package because of this certificate?\n\n  \nThanks for the help!",

                "content": "I lived in China for about 10 years, and still operate a freight forwarding company there. Prior to my time in logistics, I owned a sourcing company in China too. \n\nFrom a buyers perspective, I get the interest in EXW. You have the mindset that someone is making money on your FOB pricing, and you don\u2019t want that when EXW exists. It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for both EXW and FOB pricing from your supplier, and then get a EXW itemized quote from your forwarder, and compare the costs by removing the origin fees to get FOB. \n\nFrom a freight forwarder perspective, I really don\u2019t care what you do. Just tell me what your incoterms are so I can quote you correctly. \n\nIf you\u2019re consolidating cargo at a warehouse and shipping FCL, I will usually recommend get FOB quotes because I can use the money I charge your suppliers for the excess warehousing fees, and you don\u2019t need to pay additional warehousing. But if you ask me for itemized warehousing, I might start putting mark ups on each fee, as this is how forwarders make money. \n\nIn other words, the more line items I have to quote, the more opportunity I have to increase my margins. \n\nI had one really penny conscious customer calculate the differences between FOB and EXW, and it turned out he\u2019d only save money on EXW charges if he shipped 4+ containers at a time. But at that point, he\u2019d probably be able to negotiate a discount. \n\nI\u2019m not breaking down costs because everyone\u2019s business/products/volume differs. But you have the tools to price this out for your own sanity. \n\nUltimately, most businesses, forwarders and factories alike are not in business to take all your money from FOB charges. It\u2019s simply a means for communicating who the forwarder is going to bill for which part of the shipment.",

I owned a brokerage for 8 years and ran my friend's trucking company for about 13 years. However, when I say I ran my friend's trucking company - that was more on the accounting/office manager side of things. To this day I still can't tell you how many pallets go in a trailer. (but I did everything else)  My friend used to take the calls for the freight and he would load the truck every week. I would go online and find back halls for him. Ultimately when I started he handed me a big garbage bag of paperwork and I built the company from the ground up.  \n\nI didn't know what I was doing and I was figuring it out as I went along.  Prior to these two jobs, I've done audit in the air freight industry and my 1st foot in the door was just a logistics coordinator at a small trucking company.  I don't even know what job title I could look for at this point.  I think I take it for granted how easy everything is for me. Now I really wish I paid more attention to the LTL in filling trucks!  For the last 3 years I did payroll for a corporation (just got laid off).  And the year before that I worked at a plastics manufacturer as a production coordinator/purchasing. \n\nI would really like to get back into the transportation industry or similar. But I'll be honest, I really have no clue what job title I should be aiming for.  It's really stumped me for many years. Does anyone have a clue?? \n\nLastly, I really enjoyed purchasing chemicals /forecasting at the plastics manufacturer.  But I also love doing the numbers in the trucking industry.

Our field's been essentially devastated and we've been told we need to pivot for now.\n\nI've had an interest in the medical supply chain for a while and thought that logistics could be an interesting pivot, but I know absolutely nothing about logistics/supply chains other than what I picked up in my work. I've got some transferrable skills for sure - project management, communication, etc, - but otherwise don't know what skills to build, what knowledge to learn, or even what companies to look at. \n\nI'd love any advice on what to learn and what companies to look at for entry-level roles in logistics that are hopefully more office-based (if that's a thing). If you know of any companies that might do distribution of medicines/medical products that would take someone with no formal logistics experience, that would be fantastic too.\n\nThanks so much for helping me navigate this career transition!!",

They come in different flavors, specializing in a mode of transportation which will be more operations/focused, warehouse service providers (also more ops focused), and logistics service providers who are more about procuring, planning and executing shipments on behalf of clients.\n\nWorking for service provider will teach you the ropes and expose you to different industries, verticals, etc.  There are jobs to be filled, especially early career.\n\nBy the way, public health seems tangential to health and safety, and the transportation and warehousing suppliers have need occasionally for EH&S roles.  Maybe that could be an angle?\n\nOn the other side of the coin, you have logistics operations for the customers of these suppliers, collectively known as \u2018shippers\u2019.  You could target firms in the industries you might feel your experience would resonate with recruiters.  They probably have some entry level jobs.\n\nPM me if you want a few firms to look at.",

You can go into operations or customer service and do things like plan loads on trucks, problem solve issues with loads, tracking loads, giving customers updates on loads, etc. Freight brokerage is where a lot of people start their careers in logistics but there are other options like working for other types of logistics companies, working in shipping/logistics at a manufacturing company, etc. There are soooooo many different types of jobs in logistics and supply chain.\n\nCommunication, basic financial acumen (think picking a truck for a load and analyzing cost vs. service), able to think on your own and make decisions after a few months of settling into the role, knowing how to use email / excel / learning new systems, and some other things are the basics you need to be good at and showcase during your interviews. Have those skills and attributes and you\u2019ll be an attractive hire and employee.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to make good money in logistics. If you know how to hustle and play the game it\u2019s not unreasonable to go from $40k-100k in 3-5 years. Work your way up to something like Director of Logistics/Supply Chain and the salaries trend around $140-210k.\n\nGood luck!",

It\u2019s a headache\u2014whether you\u2019re checking out a customer, managing inventory, or shipping orders. A faulty barcode can slow down operations, cause errors, and even cost you sales.\n\nThe good news? Most barcode issues are easy to fix. Here are some of the most common problems and how to avoid them:\n\n* **Blurry or low-quality printing** \\- Make sure your printer resolution is at least 300 dpi for crisp, scannable barcodes. If durability is a concern, use thermal transfer printing instead of direct thermal to prevent fading.\n* **Wrong barcode size** \\- Most scanners require UPC barcodes to be at least 1.5 inches wide for reliable reads. Also, be sure to maintain quiet zones (blank space around the barcode) to prevent misreads.\n* **Poor placement on packaging** \\- Avoid placing barcodes on curved surfaces, seams, or folds, as this can distort the scan. Stick to flat, high-contrast areas for the best results.\n\nAlso, if your products are exposed to moisture, heat, or chemicals, use waterproof or heat-resistant labels. For added durability, consider lamination or UV coating to prevent smudging and fading.\n\nPaying attention to these small details can save you a lot of hassle.\n\n**What barcode issues have you run into in your store?**",

Urgent job offers can be made within 48 hrs to a few days, but 1-2 weeks after interviewing all candidates prior to making the offer is standard. Not all places contact rejected candidates.\n\n\nOn average, retail stores interview 3-5 candidates per position for entry-level roles and 6-10 candidates per position for management roles.\u00a0\n\n\nInterviewing twice is a great sign, especially in retail.\u00a0 Only seriously considered candidates advance to the next level.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you don't already, always end interviews with a follow up question for them to demonstrate interest (what would my day to day responsibilies/tasks will look like, can you tell me about my coworkers/team I would be working with.) It is appropriate to average eta wait time for a decision & if rejected applicants are contacted is appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTime slots are inconsistent due to the length of the interviews before you. Most interviews are 30 - 45 minutes & may run over or under.\u00a0 Also, hiring managers don't want to have down time waiting for candidates to arrive so telling an earlier time isn't unheard of.\u00a0 I recommend always arriving 15 minutes early, though, in case the person in front of you is quick or doesn't show up so they can pull you in early (it also demonstrates dependability and time management skills).\n\n\nYou've got this!",

A few things that I look for in an applicant is someone who has done a modicum of research on the company\u2026 You don\u2019t have to spew the entire story, but I have actually had people ask me \u201cwhat company is this again?\u201c when I ask them what they know about us. Literal head to hand moment.  I also personally love when people say that they have shopped in the store,  have had a great experience, love the product, etc.  \n\nBut the big thing is to be honest. There is nothing more frustrating than having what seems to be a great interview with someone who says they love customer service, they love talking to customers, they love styling outfits for people, only to find out that this person is shy/morose/surly with the general public. I don\u2019t hire to fire, so I will do my absolute best to coach the best results out of somebody, but if that person has never had any intention/desire to help customers, that is a waste of my resources, hours that could\u2019ve been given to other team members, and is truly unfair to my customers who have come to expect top-notch customer service from myself and my team.\n\nInterview your hiring manager back. Ask questions like what types of positions are available aside from service. If nothing exists, cut your losses, thank them for their time, and even ask if they\u2019re aware of any other businesses that are hiring more back of house type of positions. Most retail managers in shopping centres have networks with other retail managers, and we are all aware of each other\u2019s hiring needs.\n\nSorry for the super long response, if you\u2019ve made it this far, good luck in your job search! \u263a\ufe0f",

        "content": "Wasted 5 years of my life just to be treated poorly by 3 different managers\nJust a heads up there will be some talk involving self harm in here so if you are triggered by that you might want to skip the final story. All names in these stories have been changed just because I don't know how many of my former coworkers use reddit but at the same time if they know its me then they already know these stories. So this is a collection of stories from 3 different departments I spent time in while I was working at a grocery store. I started in the deli. It wasn't horrible at first, I mean it was my first real job so I didn't really know what to expect. We went through several different managers in the deli department due to various reasons. The manager that was last there that was a reason for my leaving was Greg. Greg was one of those lazy managers who would only really work if corpo people were visiting the store that day. Otherwise it would be my assistant manager Lily who would be busting her ass and actually organizing our department and making it run smoothly. Let me tell you all the grievances I've had with Greg. He would talk down to me (ironic because it was a foot foot and a half or so shorter than me.), he would joke about my reasons for calling in even though I rarely did, and he would be basically non existent and you would not be able to find him if you actually needed him for something. \n\nOne of the occasions I called in for was because my mother had a stroke and I was going to see her in the hospital to make sure she was ok. I called and told Lily what happened and she fully understood. Later on i was told by Lily that Greg came by and said the following. \n\nGreg: Where's Oni? Did she call in because the snow was \"blocking the roads\" again. \\*gives a shit eating smile\\*\n\nLily: Actually her mother had a stroke. She's gone to the hospital to see her. \n\nGreg: Oh...\n\nI came in the next day after checking on my mom, she was ok by the way it was minor, and I was fuming. I didn't take it out on my coworkers or anything like that but everyone could tell something was wrong. I'm prepping some stuff for our deli salads for the day and Greg walks by and talks to Lily at the very far end of the counter where I can't hear. They speak again.\n\nGreg: Hey what's going on with Oni? Is she more quiet today?\n\nLily: Actually she found out that someone had been bad mouthing her after she called in yesterday and she's pretty pissed off. \n\nAccording to Lily, Greg went pale and walked out of the deli as quickly and as quietly as he could to avoid my eye contact. \n\nNow onto the next department I worked, Produce. Everyone that I worked with over there was really chill. I liked all of them and got along with everyone, except the manager Terry. Terry was the cocky type of boss. He liked to think he kept everything running and that if it wasn't for him the whole department would go up in flames. At the same time though, he would openly tell people his desire for hoping some really rich, old, and cougar type of woman come in and spot him sweeping or taking care of the department and want him for her own. He really wanted to have a sugar mama so he didn't have to work ever again. On to my grievance with Terry. My job over here was to prep our fruit cooler with premade fruit cups, desserts, and fruit trays. I had these buckets that would store clean fresh fruit for easy prepping. I was still new in the department and I was just helping out while someone was gone for two weeks for so. \n\nSo I guess I had forgotten a bucket somewhere and forgot to rinse it out before my shift at some point. I felt bad and I made a mental note to check everything before I left my shifts. Terry told me about it at the beginning of my shift so I was very aware and knew where I messed up the other day and I wasn't going to forget. I had already had some moments where he's blown up at other people or been snippy towards me for no reason before so for this next part that happened wasn't what I intended to happen. Terry sees me finishing up for the day and walks over to the sink where I'm draining fruit juices out of the buckets. \n\nTerry: \\*in a very patronizing tone as if talking to a child\\* Now what are we going to do with the buckets when we change out the fruit?\n\nMe: \\*looks him dead in the eyes, no tone, no attitude, no face change and no angry voice\\* I'm not five..\n\nTerry: YOU DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! I AM A MANGER AND YOU DON'T DISRESPECT ME LIKE THAT. I'M GOING TO DAN (store manager) AND I'M GOING TO TELL HIM WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME!\n\nHe proceeds to storm off and passed by one of my produce coworkers Amy. She asked what he was all mad about and I tell her what happened and she simply just says \"You've got to be kidding me. He's fucking ridiculous. He can't talk to you that way and just expect you to let him treat you like that.\" She's had her own moments with him before too and I believe has spoken out about them but nothing was ever really done. I ended up getting called into the office and softly lecture by Dan it felt like he understood my side but in the end stood by Terry because Terry was the loudest freaking out over it. -\\_- Which makes sense just because usually, whenever we couldn't find Greg he would be slacking off by hanging out with Terry and Dan somewhere in the store and avoiding their duties overall. \n\nFinally we get to my last position held and the final reason for why I don't work there anymore. My final department I worked in was the bakery department. At this point retail had taken a toll on me. I had the retail depression of the dead end job feeling. I was told for my new position as a cake decorator I would be receiving a raise but I never got it even after a year of holding that potion. I was also planning a wedding and having anxiety and worries over trying to afford it and plan for it after covid was over. So I had a lot on my plate and my mental health was not exactly the best here. My fianc\u00e9 was having to help me as best as we could and we could not afford a therapist at the time. \n\nA few days before my final day at work I had come home after a really bad day where I had felt beaten down by my work, my life, my family, and everything going on. I felt so hopeless and awful. I wanted the voices in my head to stop and there was no way for me to fix any of it. I couldn't afford a therapist, I felt like I couldn't really talk to anyone who could genuinely help me, and I just wanted to end it. I hit a breaking point and I even walked into my bedroom and unlocked my fianc\u00e9's gun case and put his pistol to my head.  I was thinking about if i was ready to just be rid of it all. In a moment of panic though I thought about my fianc\u00e9 and when he would be coming home which would've been in and hour or two. If I hadn't thought about him I don't know what I would've done to be honest. \n\nWhen he did come home I, with tears streaming down my face, told him what I had done and what I thought about doing and he just held me tight and comforted me. He knew how much this job had taken out of me and everything I was going through. He helped talk me through it and told me we would work on getting me a new job, try to budget a therapist for me, and he would remove the guns from the house to keep me safe. He even gave me a bit of support saying that if I keep going to work while finding a job and I just can't take it anymore he said it's ok to just walk away from this one. He said I had his full support and that it's just one job and that he's always in my corner. \n\nThat support gave me the strength to try and put up with what I could at this job. My final boss Sarah was the boss who would try to help but would always be taken away from her work because of her being on her phone. She would constantly get phone calls from her husband, son, and daughter on a daily basis. There was not one day where she wouldn't get phone call or a text from someone during her shift and be out of a conversation with you or have to excuse herself. I gave Sarah a little break because yes she wasn't the best boss but she helped the most out of those other two, but it still wasn't a lot of help. Every time she said she would help me she ended up forgetting, skipping out on it, or just not be in work that day. \n\nNow Sarah had just recently lost her grandson due to a shooting. I felt awful to her and honestly that's probably one of the reasons that made me stay longer than I wanted to. I didn't want to leave and have her struggle to do the cake decorating tasks all alone. She herself admitted she wasn't the best at making them. She mainly did the donuts, bread and prepacked items. Though I still was struggling myself and felt I had no support system at work no matter how much I helped my coworkers and bosses. I was getting bombarded with things I needed to do, things I was doing wrong, bosses critiquing everything I did that day. At the end of my shift I felt like I had had enough. I took some paper, a pencil, wrote \"I quit\", and just left. \n\nI was a little anxious over what I did but I felt like I needed to get out of there and leave that toxicity that was taking over my life. I received a text from Sarah the next day saying \n\nSarah: Thanks for leaving us hanging like that. Really nice. No matter we'll find someone else to take your place. \n\nI snapped. I felt the stuck up tone in her voice from that text and I just fucking snapped. I unloaded on her told her how much I tried to help her while she was going through her loss, how I felt like no matter how many cakes I thought I made pretty that no one seemed to like me trying my best, that I felt like I was doing everything myself with no help and no raise to even make it worth the trouble. I told her about the gun incident I had the couple days before. I told her everything and how I didn't fucking care anymore and how I needed to put myself first for once. I ended the text with \"I'm so fucking sorry i inconvenienced you.\" \n\nLong story short, I am much happier. I have my husband, my house, my pets, and everything has gotten a lot better since quitting that horrible job.  ",

Glad you got out of that hellhole and prioritized your mental health - nobody deserves to be treated that way for a paycheck. The way Greg mocked your mom's stroke and Terry's tantrum over basic respect shows exactly why turnover in these places is astronomical. Sarah's entitled text after everything you went through is just the icing on the shit cake. Props for having the courage to just walk away when you needed to; too many people stay in soul-crushing jobs until they completely break. Hope your new chapter is treating you better!",

        "content": "A customer decided to walk into our warehouse to find non-existent stock\nIdk if this is a universal experience, but every fellow Tesco employee I have ever spoken  has experienced this strange phenomenon where customers believe the store\u2019s warehouse in the back is an infinite cornucopia of whatever they want. \n\nThey  insist we check it any time the shelves are empty of a product no matter how many times we insist that no, we\u2019ve run out. They don\u2019t seem to grasp that staff do in fact do their best to keep shelves stocked, and that if we had more in the back we would have brought it out without needing a lecture from them. \n\n\nToday however, one took this to a whole new level. I was in the meat aisle picking items for a delivery when this man asked me if we had single chicken breasts in, because he swore he\u2019d bought them before. I checked our staff app and discovered that no, we do not in fact sell single chicken breasts, only packs of two or more, and told him this. He refused to believe me and insisted we did, so I gestured to the shelves as proof. It was at this point that he accused me of hiding them in the back because I was too lazy to stock the shelves properly, and marched off to look for himself. \n\nI ended up following this guy as he went into staff only areas telling him he wasn\u2019t allowed back here, and we went around in circles as he got lost in the like three corridors before he finally found the warehouse. By this point security had joined me and were telling him the same thing, but they were just collecting evidence to call the police rather than physically intervening. He ended up finding the meat in the warehouse fridge and digging through it all, tossing stuff on the floor and at the walls and all sorts in his search. He then got told the police were on their way and at that point he panicked and ran off through the emergency exit, leaving all his shopping behind. \n\n\n  I just thought this was crazy and had to share, plus I\u2019m in a good mood because I got sent home by the store manager in case this caused me any fear or distress\u2019.

And over there, it's a very simple process, you pay for your gas with little to no problem at all. But when you get to the town an hour over, everyone assumes they can just turn on the pumps and fill up to however much they want without paying first. You get people all the time saying \"I don't know how much it'll go, can't I just fill it up?\" No. No. You can't, for very obvious theft reasons. And then you get the assholes you want to overfill just to piss you off and refund them. It happens, I had so many people spitefully get $100, only to fill to $40, or some other even number, just to ask for a refund. I know I sound insane. I think I'm going insane, but people never treat my other co workers like this. People here are genuinely insane, and the coworkers who don't come from here agree. Years and years of this has caught up to me, I can't wait til I'm done with the gas station ",

In cities it's totally normal to pay first (either at the pump or inside), but drive an hour out and suddenly people act like you're asking them to solve calculus problems when you tell them they need to prepay. The theft prevention aspect is just common sense - gas stations operate on razor-thin margins and can't afford to eat losses from drive-offs. What's especially wild is how some folks get weirdly passive-aggressive about it, deliberately overpaying then demanding refunds just to make a point. It's not like the minimum-wage cashier invented the policy! The regional differences in customer expectations around this are fascinating - same country, completely different understanding of how a basic transaction should work.\n\nBy the way, if you're a **retail executive** aiming to excel in a dynamic industry, you might be interested in a **virtual peer support group** focused on leadership and communication (**for full details, visit the website joinforum . com and search for the keyword \"retail\"**).\n\nIt's a supportive space designed to help participants navigate industry challenges, balance work-life commitments, and elevate their leadership impact.

Up until this point things had been going pretty ok! Few mistakes here and there, but no major ones - mostly with being unfamiliar with various kinds of tickets, discounts, and knowing how to use the POS machine. Normal newbie things!\n\nBut today was absolutely horrid. May have been because it was busy, and i havent worked this kind of busy before. I feel like a great idiot. \n\nA group of 4 ladies came in and wanted to all pay separately, but there was supposed to to be a 5th person who hadnt arrived yet. A coworker suggested i book them in as a family of 4 as a trick to save money but i froze up a bit because of the fact there was supposed to be a fifth person, and looking back in retrospect - this would have been a good idea. Book in a family of 4, split the cost 4 ways, they each pay separately, and then the 5th person comes in later and gets a standard ticket. Money still would have been saved for them!\n\nI was so focused on getting the transaction done fast, the line was larhe abd they were a bit late to the film iirc - so i was mostly worried about doing what they asked to a T to be as fast as possible. \n\nThen I booked one of them in the wrong aisle, i had completely forgotten which aisle i put the first woman in - so i had to do a ticket swap, and had to get a coworker to help me, as at this point i really didnt think id do it fast enough or correctly.\n\nThen i didnt think properly about which aisle i booked them in, because all 5 of them wouldnt fit into it - technically. Usually they would, there are plenty of empty seats in that aisle but for that cinema there had been some blacked out seats which were registered in the system as damaged. So i wasnt able to book those. \n\nThey aren\u2019t actually damaged, however, so i had to book the remaining ladies in the row above and explain that they could move down, and just to ignore the row letter. But me explaining this only really made things much worse as i had already booked a person in the wrong seat. \n\nWorst of all, for the first lady i neglected to exit out of the previous customers VIP account, so she had a discounted ticket, while everyone else was charged more. The paper in the receipt printer was out and we had to replace it midway through this, which only held up the que more that i was contributing to. They noticed and were very understandably annoyed. \n\nI almost forgot to give them their ice creams. They had to remind me.\n\nAfter that i left and cried in the freezer for a minute and came back out to the front again.\n\nI as well kept on freezing up when customers gave me extra money in order to round up their change. its such a simple thing in retrospect, just take the change they need and add on that bit extra they give you. But i kept on getting flustered. Customer had to pull up a bloody calculator for me\u2026christ man. \n\nI cried in front of my coworkers. I feel like im just really not cut out for this after today, those poor ladies just wanted to see a film together. \n\n",

But it is still a highly demanding job with a lot of stress and pressure, and the salary is kinda low compared to the amount of work I do.\n\n\n\nI'm planning to change the industry and I'm thinking about how to explain it during my future job interviews. Of course I will mention the low pay and limited career advancement opportunities, but I'd also like to name some of the macro-economic cons of the retail industry (compared to other industries).\n\n\n\nSo far I came up with these:\n\n\\- low margins,\n\n\\- stagnant growth,\n\n\\- market saturation,\n\n\\- losing market share to online business (I specialize on brick and mortar stores),\n\n\\- limited productivity growth.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? \n\n\n\nAlso if you don't agree with me and think that the retail industry is actually better than other industries, please let me know your opinion, this can be a thread to discuss global pros and cons of the retail industry in general.",

Whatever doesn't fit in the cars goes in the tanks. You can then use the gas in these tanks to \"stretch out\" your gas life.\n\nSolves the problem of having to wait for a refund because they use up all the money. Hell, they might see that as saving money because it means they can go *even longer* before having to run back into town for more gas.",

I'm tired of not making money for my value, any one here with retail experience knows what I'm saying. \nTo make this short, my last 2 months at gamestop I was top 10 if not top 1 every week in selling memberships, warranties and UPT. But now, I'm married and in my mid 20s, I wanna be making 40k+ a year. Not 20k a year to run retail stores. Disregard the title at this point, i don't need a job, I need a career. I don't \"Love\" the law or flying planes or coding a video game, I love my family, my friends, my dogs, so I didn't need to \"Love\" my career, I just need to enjoy it enough, make money, and get out of retail\n\nSo far my highest interest is in mattresses or insurance, but insurance is less due to my appearance (im tattooed out the wazoo and have piercings that it seems mattress places won't discriminate over) I'm not sure entirely what actual sales is as opposed to retail, but I do know my performance and drive is high. I can sell anything (hopefully I'm not naive \ud83d\ude02)\nAny thoughts, advice, stories, companies, etc will help, and honestly for whatever it's worth in my search, I have no degrees, 8 years in retail, a year in food, 2 years in educational environments, and I am in New Mexico USA.

At the age I should have been doing so, I started my own business (not retail, different story) that became my career for 10 years.  When that failed, I immediately resorted back to retail jobs.  Ultimately, I've ended up in grocery store management.  And I wish I'd settled in to this as a career path earlier, because it's pretty decent.  I'm an assistant store manager for a major grocery store. I make 75k a year, which is really good money in my area (not rich, but a legit living - my wife makes similar money, so between us, we're very comfortable).  I get 4 weeks vacation and another 2 weeks worth of personal days.  No official sick time but I'm salary, so if I miss a day my pay doesn't change.  I work indoors and my company is one that insists on workplace safety and respect in the workplace.  There are more demanding weeks, but I generally work about 45-50 hours a week.  It's a career that goes as well as your attitude.  I worked some shitty jobs for a few years that helped give me perspective.   I get paid to manage problems.  If there were no problems, they wouldn't need me.  So I don't get too upset with problems.   If you give in to the water-cooler bitching and listen to people be miserable....  the job can suck.  But if you keep in perspective that you're just selling cans of peas and need to make that profitable,  it's pretty decent.  You'll need to start lower on the totem pole, and work your way up. But hard workers with leadership skills who have rock solid attendance and good attitudes about managing retail issues will move up quick in almost any company.",

Because I'd established a reputation with a store I delivered to, I came in as a full-time manager-in-training.  This was for the stock crew, so it wasn't glorified and it did include $2 overnight pay, which made it more reasonable.   In hindsight, not many get hired that way, but get in the door, the lower positions are better than you think.  Just make it known you're interested in career positions to your local stores.  Dress appropriately and introduce yourself to store management in the area.  Be humble and don't oversell and don't talk their ear off.  Just make a point to introduce yourself as a retail manager hoping to pursue career positions in grocery, and if they'd ever like to sit down and talk....  and then get out of their way.  We have trouble filling our department manager positions.  We'd love to get talent that wants to be successful and move up.  From Stocking shelves, I got lucky again and caught the eye of a store manager who knew I could do better things and scored a role as evening manager (solely responsible for the store 95% of the shift).  2 years doing that and the same manager wanted me as his assistant when that became available.  I'm considered one of the best, so I could easily pursue a store manager job if I wanted.  I'm just at a point in life where I want to play golf with my dad rather than take on bigger roles.  But there is an absolute lack of talent coming through the ranks.  If you can get in at a level you can power through, advancement is almost guaranteed in most grocery chains for those who can learn the business and embrace it.",

Any Sonic that does, isn't using it legally (as in, they're probably doing one of those tap cube things where it actually is sending the money to someone's account that they're then paying for with). \n\nIt's because Apple pay, tap pay, Google pay, Samsung pay.. all those.. are not actual banks. They're just 3rd part go-betweens. In order for certain places to be able to utilize them, not only does the proper technology need to be in place (RFID readers built in, and even chip readers need specialized programming), but there also need to be the proper licenses FROM applepay, etc, to use it. \n\nFor Sonics, I'm told that the machines don't have the chip sensor programming for the chip pay, and applepay refuses to purchase the proper licensing to utilize the programs/software that Sonic uses, and so... Sonic can't do the applepay. Now they did update the app and got the licenses to accept the Apple pay in the app.\n\nBut there's a lot of other places that don't take it too. A lot of gas stations, convenience stores, or quick shops won't give you any cash back and require a minimum purchase on all tap pay or Apple pay services. It's because applypay isn't a bank. It's a middle man. I'll stick by it.",

That is enough information for them to start a new profile of your spending habits (if you\u2019ve never ever used a card at Walmart), but it\u2019s typically a long game and they compile that card information with what you willingly provide them through their Walmart app (mobile pay, QR code, etc.) they\u2019re adding that to a profile of you that only they can see.\n\nWalmart is huge on data collection, they\u2019re not a simple large retailer.",

What do I do now...\nI wasn\u2019t sure where else to post this, but I need to vent a bit and get some guidance on my next steps.\n\nRecently, I was laid off out of nowhere. I had been with my company for nine years, consistently received great performance reviews, and then suddenly\u2014it all just ended.\n\nI have over 20 years of experience in IT across various roles. I hold an associate degree but not a bachelor's. My career started at a local computer shop, and after a few years, a college connection helped me land a job with a federal contractor. I later moved to another federal contractor, where I spent 10 years and truly enjoyed my work. Eventually, I took on a new role that was less IT-focused and more business/IT-oriented. While I learned new skills, I never found the job particularly challenging or fulfilling, though the salary was good. I stayed there until a few months ago.\n\nThis entire experience has really shaken my confidence. I\u2019ve applied to countless IT jobs but have heard back from almost none. I\u2019ve tailored my resume to fit the positions, and I did get one interview that I thought went well, but I was rejected after just two days. I suspect my lack of a bachelor\u2019s degree or certifications may be holding me back, but I\u2019m not certain. In my previous roles, my associate degree was always enough\u2014but now, I wonder if that\u2019s no longer the case.\n\nNow for the guidance part: I don\u2019t know what to do next. Should I pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree? While doing that, should I also work on certifications like CompTIA A+, Network+, or Security+? I\u2019ve also seen Google\u2019s professional certificates\u2014are those worth considering?\n\nFor those currently in IT roles, what do you recommend I focus on? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

The only CS related certifications I've done after high school have been these higher education certifications from the British computer society, like their certificate and diploma levels. Recently, I started learning Python and I've realised that the lack of just any IT stuff in my life was making me unhappy. I still want to get my medical degree, but I don't want to be just a doctor by the end of it. Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can do to maybe pivot my career in a way that both IT and medicine are accounted for?",

After you've been working for a while as a doctor or whatever, you can better assess whether or not you want to stay in your current field or not.

Download Git and figure out how to push your projects to GitHub, then tinker around with what you're interested in. Build a website, API, video game, doesnt matter.Just keep watching videos/expanding your knowledge/making impressive projects. Then start throwing out applications showcasing what you can do, and really try to target keywords. If you can get past the filters and in an interview and show you're passionate/talented you're golden.\n\nKeep pursuing the medical stuff in the meantime. The market is tough and a good idea to have alot of options and medical is a very good field to be in. Who knows maybe one day you could use the medical experience on a resume to land a high paying tech job in the medical field.\n\nGood luck",

You will always face discrimination from folks who got the degree and feel like it makes them a superior developer just because, and you will also notice kind of fast that not every developer with a degree is any better than dog shit. Some of them are even very lazy and entitled. At the end of the day, if you get in and can keep a job, it\u2019s more meritocratic from the vantage point of anyone who should matter to you. You should try to get the degree though, as if you have no connections, you won\u2019t be fruitful cold applying without it in this market (assuming no experience). You may also face issues later on when applying to new jobs, as many have a hard degree requirement, or sub in a degree for x years of experience.

Next thing you know they've learned how to be a Salesforce admin \\[which is to say, they're essentially no-code developers\\].

Currently thinking about making a switch from current role and they\u2019re constantly recruiting in London, I\u2019ve seen loads and loads of roles being advertised all over. Mostly on Otta, but I\u2019ve been contracted by 3rd party recruiters even which I didn\u2019t think Amazon would use.\n\nAnyway, they\u2019re the only big tech that I think my skills would match up for, I\u2019m a c# dev for the most part but Microsoft haven\u2019t been hiring for mid-level that I\u2019ve seen in the UK.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of Amazon reviews that really don\u2019t paint a good picture of the place but I reckon even if I last a year it\u2019ll be a lot better for my CV then my current role. So my questions:\n\nIs Amazon in London similar to the situation in America, where it seems wlb is horrible, you\u2019re under constant pressure etc?\n\nDo Amazon do on site for tech rounds in London/UK or do they do that remotely? I\u2019m somewhat far from London so would prefer to do it remotely.\n\nLastly, are they 5 day in office in London too or is that an America only situation?\n\nThanks for any answers in advance",

I recently completed my studies and applied to a well-known company that pays according to a collective agreement. They made me an offer placing me in pay grade 7 out of 8 (with an automatic promotion to grade 8 after one year). Additionally, I was classified in the category 'Years of experience: 7'.\n\nDid the company make a mistake, or are they recognizing my study period, student work experience, or something similar as professional experience? I'm pretty confused. On one hand, I'm happy about it, but on the other hand, I'm afraid that too much will be expected of me. Or is this normal?",

I've had a previous SWE summer internship at an investment company (sophomore year), multiple research positions / side projects and was a former TA for multiple introductory courses at Berkeley. I was also a former tech leadership position at my debate club. Projects on my resume include an email script and machine learning models. I have a publication at NASA, was a former student board member of UC Berkeley's newest college and have an award from Google (the latter was an award given to a lot of students, but still, its an award from Google).\n\nI've gotten multiple interviews, arrived at the final round (passing previous behavioral and/or technical round), but keep getting rejected. I know it's not a resume issue, because I've been getting OAs and/or interviews from Fortune 500 companies, but I always fail to pass the final round.\n\nAs I keep applying, the responses are shrinking and honestly, it's kinda demotivating. I've been applying since August, with 350ish applications (and counting). Am I just not applying to enough companies?\n\n*How bad is the market?*\n\nLast year, I applied to 200 max internships and got my offer by the end of March.\n\nAny tips on applying / securing the final round?

Startups aren't my first choice, but they're something I'm willing to do, if it comes to the worst possible scenario.\n\nWhen a person interns at an established company, then interns at a startup, I'd wonder why they \"moved down\", if that makes sense. The company I'm interning for rn, is my last resort option *if* I don't get any offers, but once again, it kinda sucks to move from paid to unpaid, established company to unestablished company, especially because my goal was to work for a bigger company as a junior. It's definitely disappointing to not get what you want, especially if you do have the qualifications to get what you want. Sure, this can be a *subjectively* wrong opinion, but at the end of the day, I have experience with both established companies *and* startups, and ultimately prefer established companies.\n\nMaybe I *am* picky for this market, but I do know what I want, and am ultimately frustrated with how things aren't going the way they're supposed to.

With AI and the negative PR happening of our industry, two things will happen:\n\n1. People will rely on AI more than developing actual skills the hard way. \n2. There will be reduction in the number of people signing up for software engineering thinking there is no future. \n\nNow this will create a shortage of good engineers. And it fuel again fuel the demand and hopefully it will work in the favour of all the senior engineers and the ones who are truly passionate about software engineering and gonna start fresh. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n ",

If the cost of writing code is cheap, you can standup a team of some engineers per saas dependency and replace it instead of paying a lot on a contract with another external company (splunk, auth, jira, gusto, salesforce  etc). Why use <insert saas company> now that I can have that custom built in house for cheaper/faster and more customized? Then why use public cloud when running and maintaining your own infrastructure becomes trivial due to AI? This should theoretically lead to more engineers being hired in the long run due to the need to maintain and rebuild projects more and more instead of paying to reuse a solution. Only small Companies need this, big companies can remove these dependencies",

Open to hearing everyone out. \n\nHey everyone, I graduated with a CS degree in 2023, maintaining a high GPA, and completed an internship focused on Application Security testing. I\u2019ve always been interested in Cyber Security and Software Engineering (SWE).\n\nPost-graduation, I landed a job with a government agency, which was a dream role for me. However, hiring freeze impacted the position, and while I haven't been rejected, it\u2019s been uncertain.\n\nI didn't apply to jobs during my senior year because I was focused on maintaining my scholarship and grades. After graduation, I didn\u2019t apply as much as my peers. I had to take care of a family member full time, which was emotionally and mentally taxing. While I did manage to get technical interviews, I struggled to progress beyond that stage due to a lack of time and effort in preparation. I believe my competition had more experience and quicker turnaround times.\n\nNow, almost two years later, I\u2019m facing a significant gap in my resume. I've also lost some of my drive during this time, but I\u2019m ready to shift my priorities and get back into the field. I\u2019ve been applying consistently since January, but haven\u2019t seen much positive feedback. I know I could\u2019ve worked on projects and kept building my skills during this time, but I had personal obligations that took precedence.\n\nI'm looking for advice from those with experience in the field or who have gone through a similar situation. How can I get back into the market, and how do I explain this gap?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

For front end and back end i'm going with React & Node, but for everything else, especially devops, i'm scared to choose and i don't want to dig myself to deep. I could use some advice when it comes to database/hosting/devops stuff.\n\nThe project consists of a web platform with user accounts, course buying/refunds, doing the courses (watching videos with copyright protection), and making appointments. Payment API has been decided by the client and it has Node, Go, Python implementations. At the moment there is no expectation of more than a few hundred active users at a time.\n\nIf you can give me any advice or point me to articles helping me decide on different aspects it'd be much appreciated!

        "content": "3 YOE, Losing hope\nI know it's just really hard to get an interview nowadays, but I feel like I'm very well qualified, especially for my age, and don't know where I could be going wrong. I just graduated in June 2024 from the University of Chicago with a BS in Computer Science, a specialization in Machine Learning, and a minor in Data Science. I had to work close to full time along my classes, and then of course full time during summer, so I'm at \\~3 YOE at a smaller company where due to my performance during my internship period (been programming since beginning of high school) I skipped the junior level position and got hired into their mid-senior level.\n\nI know I'm lucky just to have a job in the first place, but it's very frustrating because I've only ever had 3 real interviews in my career, all in 2022 (1 of course being for my current job/the internship for it, 1 where I made it to the final round of Amazon internship before being rejected, and 1 for a healthcare tech internship). I've spent 3 years continually applying to jobs, and even now applying to entry level positions the most I get is the rare automated Leetcode style test that I'll ace and then never hear anything else about. I've tried switching up my resume, putting my all into non-ChatGPT'ed cover letters where I actually had a tangible reason to be passionate about the position, and even recently started just cold-messaging anyone associated with talent acquisition and recruiting that had public messages open on LinkedIn to try and get my application noticed. Nothing works, and I'm scared of becoming stagnant and falling behind, as my current position is super easy and I feel like I'm not learning or improving anymore. To me it feels like I'm close to as qualified as I can be for my age, although I will admit I don't have any sort of public portfolio for myself, and that's the only idea I have left is building myself a portfolio website (I know I probably should have done that awhile ago, but I just never got around to it). The way it's been going, I don't know how anyone could possibly make it if they didn't have the same level of opportunity that I've had so far to pad their resume, but some people do make it with just a small coding boot camp and a year of professional experience, so I'm left wondering if there's just something I'm not doing right.\n\nP.S. I guess I should mention I've gotten some looks for BS 2 person startups that want me to come run half the company's tech for a 5% raise from my current position and like 0.005% equity, but I don't really think those count",

                "content": "I've been aggressively networking on Linkedin for the past 3-4 months heavily, with slow and steady success. Here is my learnings:\n\nFirst thing is unfortunately you have to invest in career premium (preferably business premium) because without it, you'll get rate limited on how many connection requests you can send. Even with business premium, you are at 200 connection requests a week, but business give you unlimited people browsing which is huge. You can do without it, but it will be substantially slower since you won't be able to add notes to all connection requests, get unlimited ppl browsing, etc.\n\nNext thing to realize that it's a numbers game, you're a salesperson trying to build your network and show them you're worth accepting. What people do often is connect because they see a role right now. This isn't the way to do it. You're not connecting for the immediate moment, rather, you are making connections for WHEN there is an opportunity in the future.\n\n  \nNow time to connect.   \n\\- Search \"Engineering Manager\" and you'll get to people browse managers. \n\n\\- Try to target mid sized startup managers and better, those usually have roles cycle in and out.\n\n\\- Always add a note introing yourself, (I want to build my network, love to connect about future roles, etc).\n\n\\- Always make sure you are adding someone with a mutual connection. Else you're probably wasting a connection request on your quota\n\n\\- If not mutual connection, then try same alma mater. then tailor your note to \"Hello fellow <X college or maybe your mascot if you call yourselves that> alumni!\", i've actually had tons of success with this, most of my school alumni are super prideful.\n\n\\- You can try to connect with recruiters, but most if not all recruiters aren't too helpful over linkedin messaging, especially at big companies where they probably get 100-200 mails a day. Engineering Managers get way less and more likely to accept you.\n\n  \nOut of 200 i send a week, I get maybe 20-25 acceptances.\n\nNext part is most important. Follow up once they accept. Start a convo, them about culture, what is interesting about working at X company, or whatever you want to ask\n\nout of the 20-25, i get maybe 2-3 responses where they are super communicative.\n\n  \nNow i've made a relationship. Most that reply usually end if with a helping hand. Some users don't even care about talking, they just say \"great to connect, LMK if you need a referral\" especially if they were an alumni, or have mutual connection. Some love a good conversation. and then offer help.\n\nSo it's a lot of work, but it is absolutely worth it and I've gotten some engineering managers directly reach out to me about positions they know they are posting soon.\n\n  \nA key point here too is, as you do it you'll grow your network and have more and more mutuals to leverage, so future connection requests will get a higher percentage of acceptances. I've noticed this.\n\nThis market is cutthroat and you gotta go the extra mile to stand out. Hopefully you can take what i've learned and apply it.",

I've even had people cold-message me asking for referrals to the company that *laid me off*(they can see in my work history I don't work there any more). It's a very strange place.\n\n> Okay, I pressed the connect button, and now what? I text them after getting accepted, but I rarely ever hear back from them.\n\nThis is really all there is to it; if they're not replying to you it's presumably because they have nothing to offer/aren't hiring SWE's.\n\nLike other users have said - LinkenIn, like Facebook, is more for keeping connected with people you've already met by networking IRL, not for networking with strangers on the site. The only exception is when you see someone with the #Hiring flair post that they're actually looking for new workers with a skillset/value set matching their post.

I'm currently not certain about which career path I shall follow and what industrial knowledge I shall learn on my own.\n\n\n\nSkills I currently have: basic Java and C (but IDK any SDE framework like Spring yet), Python (mainly for database), Go (with serverless experience), big data systems (like HDFS, Spark, Cassandra, etc. and very passionate about them, but only have course projects so far), JavaScript and React (limited to course project now but starting a personal project soon). I do not know C++.\n\nExperiences I have: one industrial internship on database ETL using Python (pandas) and AWS S3 at a non-CS company, one academic open-source project on serverless using Go (but no recruiters are interested), one academic research using Java with journal published (but also no recruiters are interested)\n\n\n\nI don't know which path shall I take:\n\n1. Learn Spring and become a software engineer, but I need to start from 0 about software structure and still only have mediocre interest in it.\n\n2. Learn NodeJS and become a frontend engineer, but uncertain about how big the market could be. It may sound satirical that many companies are making frontends with OpenAI API but I still think it means large job market potential.\n\n3. Learn to become a data engineer. This is my ideal position and I emphasized it on my resume, yet I always get mistaken as a data analyst. I also wonder what industrial knowledge shall I learn.\n\n4. Learn to become a DevOps engineer. I currently only know how to deploy a cloud VM and use docker. I wonder whether I need to get a couple of AWS certificates in order to actually help companies maintain their cloud.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions, comments, etc. are welcome. I just need to decide which career I shall take and what to learn for the following months before the next fall recruiting season. Thanks in advance.",

                "content": "I\u2019m sure there are plenty of uses that I\u2019m not aware of. For me, I\u2019ve primarily used them in distributed systems for data processing, machine learning model deployment/training, and REST APIs. Basically anything where you might have high volumes of data, and need to be able to scale services up or down based on workload demand. You scale up when you have a lot of data throughput and high demand. You scale down when you have low demand so you can save money on resources that aren\u2019t in use. \n\n\nFocus on AWS infrastructure. Most of the industry uses it, so it\u2019s your best bet. I\u2019ve never actually worked anywhere that used anything other than AWS. Although I would say, learn about on-prem deployments as well because this will give you a more holistic understanding. AWS can abstract a lot of things and learning on-prem will give you a better idea of what\u2019s going on under the hood. \n\n\nBiggest things to know (aka high demand skills) in no particular order: \n\n\n1. Commonly used Python libraries for data processing, ML, AWS, FastAPI, things like that. \n\n\n2. AWS infrastructure. Mostly how to use them, but also how to set them up if you end up going the DevOps route (Cloud Formation).\n\n\n3. Containerization, primarily Docker. Know what\u2019s going on under the hood for Docker, I get questions like that in almost every interview. Know the difference between virtualization. Know Dockerfile best practices. \n\n\n4. REST APIs. Mainly how they work, basic networking, and how to create a schema. \n\n\n5. Ways to scale high volume data services. Kubernetes, ECS, etc. \n\n\n6. Logging, monitoring, and alerting practices. Common tools like Prometheus and Grafana. \n\n\n7. Infrastructure used for microservices like message queues. \n\n\n8. Some MLOps knowledge will take you a long way. \n\n\n9. General Linux commands \n\n\n10. CI/CD tools and best practices. \n\n11. It won\u2019t hurt to get some more Go experience as well.\n\n\nThese are the things I can think of off the top of my head. It will take you a while to learn everything, and even longer the gain expertise. But showing some basics awareness of these concepts as a new grad will take you far. It also lines up with what you already know pretty well. \n\n\nIn addition, these things are used in a pretty wide variety of roles. So you are keeping your options open. Python Backend, MLOps, Data engineer, you\u2019ll get interviews for all of those types of roles. It also places you tangential to DevOps, although coming from these other roles you\u2019d need some more DevOps self study to really crack a DevOps interview. But you will get DevOps interviews with this knowledge. I know because I often get DevOps interviews but rarely do well in them lmao. I\u2019ve worked primarily in Backend and MLOps.",

I\u2019ve made a personal list of things I think I should do, based on my own observations, performance reviews, and opinions. I thought I\u2019d share it with you and see what you think. **If you have more ideas/recommendations, do comment!**\n\nBasically, I treat it like a video game: getting to know my surroundings, what each \"NPC\" does, how to level up, and what starting tools or items I have.\n\n1. Get coffee with everyone you can. Absorb information. Don't be all business\u2014socialize, especially in a small team. Have 1:1 meetings with as many people as possible. Find a work buddy who can vouch for you and possibly refer you later (potentially a tech buddy). Build relationships with co-workers who are happy to help.\n2. Don't lie. Don't get drunk. Don't gossip.\n3. Show effort: In tech, effort matters as much as results. Show willingness by occasionally staying an extra 30 minutes when needed and volunteering for tasks. Stay motivated and take initiative.\n4. **Secure Early Wins, Show Results:** Get an early victory by completing a visible task exceptionally well. Prove yourself through your first few assignments. Be thorough and put in extra hours during your first month. Make your first contribution in week one\u2014find something small and manageable, then excel at it. Remember: \"If you have a reputation for coming in early, you can be late every day.\" Put in extra effort at the beginning to establish yourself as reliable. In a good workplace, this builds trust and flexibility. When tackling your first deliverable, go above and beyond\u2014people will respect you and invest in your success.\n5. **Effective Communication with Boss, 90 day plan**: Have five key conversations with your boss about situational diagnosis, expectations, communication styles, resource needs, and personal development. Use these to create your 90-day plan. Understand your manager's expectations for your first 30 to 90 days. Stay proactive, track your contributions, and maintain regular progress updates.\n6. Keep weekly reports in Apple Notes. Take thorough notes about possibly everything.\n7. Don't wait 5-7 months to show your potential, as commonly advised. Be brave, bold, and confident to get ahead. Don't fear being inventive, but avoid showing off or making immediate changes. Be polite to everyone. Combine the confidence of a mid-level employee with a junior's eagerness to learn.\n8. Get up, dress up, and show up.\n\n\n\nPS: This is not for karma farming. I\u2019m not self-promoting or asking a question here. I made notes for myself based on my own experiences, and shared them, hoping they\u2019d be useful to someone. That's all.",

                "content": "You should talk with your manager about the 30/60/90 plan for you. That's basically their expectations of where you should be at the end of each of your first three months.\n\nIn my experience though, the first 30 days is really just getting the codebase checked out, being able to build the product you'll be working on, learning how the product itself works, learning the company processes, and meeting your coworkers.\n\nYou should be proactive and book 30 minutes with your immediate teammates to learn what they work on. You also want to try to figure out which of your teammates seem the most likely to help you when you get stuck. Some companies will assign a first month mentor that's your goto for questions, but that's been an exception to the rule in my experience.\n\nFor a senior eng role, I would expect by the end of 30 days you are able to fix a basic bug in the codebase with help from teammates. By 60 days you can fix bugs independently. By 90 days you have started simple feature work.\n\nThis has been my experience all the way through senior staff level. After that point things start to diverge more based on what part of the product you were hired to work on.",

And all of it is great advice if you are new and this is your first job.  You don't know what you want from the job yet, so just try to fit in.\n\nHowever, if you are experienced and trying to find a job that is a better fit for you, then do that.  It's starts before even applying, but once you've taken the plunge and think you've found the right job, you need to set a precedent early.  Don't go into the job with the goal of having a strong work-life balance, and then start volunteering to stay late and take on projects that will hinder your goal.  Then later on you have to try to change that expectation, and that could cause friction.\n\nEarly wins should be easy wins to demonstrate contributions, but if your goal is to work for a company who can see past their nose and has a bigger plan for you, then that probably doesn't matter as much.  Just make sure the expectations are known before even starting the job and make sure they are inline with your goals.  Or if you just need money and they just want you to bust out features as quick as possible, then do that, as long as that is the expectation by everyone.",

So the extra time would be spent solving those damning installations errors and learning the stack, rather than developing the product. By using extra time for your own on-boarding, you may be able to demonstrate some progress on \"product tasks\" during this time and make a better impression.  \nOnce the trial period has passed, and you don't need to spend as much time on your on-boarding, you can keep showing similar or often improved productivity on product tasks while working contractual hours.  \n\nCompetent engineering managers know that engineers need 3 to 9 months to become fully productive, but it's difficult to judge how competent is your manager during your trial period, so I think it's worth it investing additional time in making a positive impact during the trial period.\n\nAgain, in an ideal world, you have a great manager that will straight up tell you that he doesn't expect you to be fully productive before 6 months, that you should take your time to learn, respect your contract hour, rest well and relax so you can be in the best conditions to learn efficiently over a couple of months.",

They have a lot of local options now and they don't want the hassle of bringing someone from abroad.\n\nOne suggestion I can make though is that change your address to the city you want to move in. The recruiters search for cities. You will make it easier for them to find you. And as you might know having a recruiter that reached out to you is a big advantage.\n\nIf they don't explicitly say they support visas, ask in advance before scheduling a call! You can also mention that all you need is time for the visa application to go through and couple of emailed papers from the company along with the contract. Visa applications are not that complex once you have a bachelors+ degree, you can do it on your own.  Also don't expect for monetary relocation support.\n\nMost recruiters are oblivious to visa processes and they tend to think of them as complicated affairs. If you assure them that you can handle it on your own you might keep your interviews going.",

I enjoy programming but only when it entails problem solving. There's really barely any problem solving in a full-stack developer role. It's just save data, mutate, make the DB faster, implement some UI functionality, write tests, rinse and repeat.\n\nI took tons of math courses, linear algebra, information theory, probability, combinatorics and it's an overkill for what I do as a career. Having a CS degree for React is basically getting a math degree to balance a checkbook.\n\nIs it possible to switch to some other kind of programming or am I too delusional and should accept what I get.\n\nThank you.\n\nBsC in CS, don't get taken serious(no interview) by serious companies that do either systems level programming & HFT firms, total years of experience = 2.\n\n  \nEDIT: Once in a blue moon I got a similar algorithmic problem as a bug and it was the most fun I ever had on a ticket.

The web stuff on your CV will likely be ignored by the hiring manager, so maybe start working on interesting personal projects. That's what has been getting me interviews from top trading firms consistently. I think I've been invited to an interview for every single HFT application I sent out, even though my job had nothing to do with low-latency C++.",

There's a bunch of hardware startups in this space like Tenstorrent. Get a card from them and start writing high-performance libraries targeting Tensix cores.\n\nJust an example, I'm not a GPU guy.

What are the most important things I should focus on? That is, what should I be spending the most time working on?\n\nMy current strategy is to grind out DS&A concepts and problems to the point of exhaustion for technical interview questions. Next in the priority would be to brush up on Java/OOP concepts. Thoughts on this? \n\nA few more questions:\n- What frameworks/technologies do I need to learn for fintech jobs?\n- Do I need to make projects as well in Java for an entry level position? \n- Should I learn Spring/is it expected of a fresh junior dev to know this?\n- What about databases? I am extremely rusty on them at the moment.\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you. \n",

The person said that the job would use Python and Go, so I assume there would be some coding.\n\nI've read the other posts on this subreddit regarding devops and I still was a bit confused.\n\nI have a couple of questions regarding that:\n\n1. For those who have done DevOps or is in DevOps, do you think the skills that is learned from this position make me a better candidate for a development role in the future? Or would it be better to look for a development role (assuming I had one). I do still want to go into backend development in the future.\n2. What is the interview process like for DevOps position? Keep in mind this is an internship position- I'm not too sure what to expect.\n\n  \nThanks!",

The problem is that as soon as I apply, my current employer will find out.

Taking bigger risks makes sense when time is on your side to compound returns and make-up for sacrifices later. \n\nOnce the finish line is visible, you need a more grounded decision framework that weighs immediate quality of life against diminishing future returns since it's not a given that compounding effects will have enough time to work it's magic.\n\nToo many people realize this too late, often after retirement. They carry regret from maintaining an aggressive growth mindset through their entire career when they should have optimized for life satisfaction in the third act. The trick is recognizing when to make that shift.",

Early opportunities create more future opportunities, so initial sacrifices for growth can dramatically impact your trajectory over decades.\n\nThat same opportunity near the end of your career has less time to compound. Its value becomes mostly limited to its immediate impact, with diminishing long-term returns. \n\nThis shifts the calculus. When compounding effects no longer have time to create broad significance, you need to critically examine your actual goals.\n\nThe key point: we're not optimizing for some final career \"high score\" that we get to enjoy forever. We only have our life to experience, both working years and retirement. \n\nIf you never transition from pure growth optimization to quality of life considerations, you risk reaching a marginally \"better\" career endpoint while sacrificing years of potential life satisfaction. \n\nThe tragic realization often comes too late. Optimizing for integrated value over your actual lifetime would have led to a far better lived experience than endlessly chasing growth.\n\nThe point isn't to stop pursuing growth at all. It's that question of whether the price (free time, stress, enjoyment of work days, etc) is acceptable reletive to the expected marginal increase in personal growth between now and the end because a more complicated to answer. \n\nIt's only a near automatic \"yes\" when you have plenty of time left.",

I didn\u2019t study CS in college, but there were some Java classes in my IT degree. \n\nMy job revolves around building apps that talk to a crud saas the company uses to run the business. It has a fully exposed rest API but doesn\u2019t have any integrations with third party services, so a lot of my job is integrating the APIs together in my apps. \n\nI started from the very basics with jquery and php since it\u2019s all I knew. Eventually I switched to react with a python backend since it was a bit faster to ship with. \n\nI\u2019m super grateful just to have a job in this market, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m screwing myself by staying here. I have no manager, no other devs, and wfh. This gives me a lot of freedom to experiment but also zero structure and feedback.\n\nEvery day I feel conflicted between doubling down on studying coding or focusing on IT carts like CCNA. On one hand I already have a coding job, but there\u2019s no mentorship and I\u2019m probably doing a lot of things wrong or using bad practices. On the other, I already have an IT degree so networking seems like a more logical direction, however I\u2019m not getting IT experience right now and would most likely take a big pay cut to switch to support. \n\nWhat do you guys think I should do? Either way I\u2019ll probably be here for the forseeable future given how bad the market is.",

If someone offers you something awesome, take it and leave on good terms. Offer consulting or w/e during the transition period. \n\nI was in a similar situation as a solo dev for a 200 person company, one day it got acquired by another and they had their own programmers. So effectively I spent the last 3 months transitioning my work to the other team, and then did some consulting for a few more months while being employed somewhere else. Like you I was very grateful for the opportunity they gave me and wanted things to be smooth when I left.\n\nI think as a solo dev you probably have a really good understanding on how software works as a whole, from code to infrastructure. W/e you are missing, you'll pick up quickly. And working on teams is its own experience that I think is useful for everyone to have.",

You don\u2019t necessarily know how to architect or write software, but you have to have a deep systems knowledge in order to know how a system can be compromised. We also joke that our SEs have a natural state of paranoia, but you also need that, to be able to imagine the various ways in which attackers can get at your system, escalate privilege, and do bad things. There are SEs at our company who work solely on red-teaming our systems, but for the most part, SEs run corp/product security programs, and do security consulting with product teams.",

I heard back from a recruiter about 1/4 of the time, and got moved to some kind of \"real\" initial screen (typically a vibe check with the manager) about 1/10 of the time. Many leet-y coding assessments, 6 significant take-home assignments, moved to the final round 7 times.\n\nIDK if I have any secret sauce, but here is my process.\n\n1. Only apply to jobs where there is a strong match. Specifically an 80% match including the top 3 requirements. Also a geographic match; if they're not hiring people from my state, they're not going to carve out a special exception just for me.\n2. I include cover letters if there is a space for them. They specifically mention \"the $TITLE position at $ORGANIZATION\", and also mention things I have done that are in the posting.  I know a lot of people say no one looks at them or cares, but I definitely noticed a difference in response rates when I include one. I got to where I can write one in 5 minutes flat.\n3. Any interviews I get, I keep the job posting and the \"about the company\" web page up so I can target all my answers to what they are/want, and not shoot myself in the foot by saying I'm interested in working \"someplace smaller and newer where I can have a real impact\" when talking to a humongous company that has been in business for a hundred years. Especially important for the critical question of salary! Which thank God a lot of recruiters are including in the posting these days, so you can make sure your range overlaps with their range.\n4. A spreadsheet with all the jobs applied for, a link to the posting, where we are in the process, and brief notes. This ensures you're not applying to the same company twice, and lets you poke recruiters if the process seems to have stalled. I will admit I am not great at writing thank-you notes after interviews, but it would be good for that. You can also identify trends of what's working and what's not.\n5. A longer document with more detailed notes about things discussed. Honestly, mine is just a big disorganized blob in Notion, but still a massive improvement over not having it. Sometimes recruiters give you big hints about what they'll ask in the final round, but it doesn't happen for a month. Or the hiring manager mentions some attribute they especially want. Or you see something concerning on Glass Door. Probably especially useful if you are trying to \"Crack Company X no matter how many times I have to apply\"\n6. Leetcode QOTD to stay nimble. Any questions tagged for that company leading up to interviews.\n7. Study, study, study. Any place I realized my knowledge wasn't where it should be. In my case, that was a lot of stuff around system design (Kafka, CDNs, Cassandra. Also a lot of \"design Netflix\" and \"design hotels.com\" kind of stuff.)",

Will my colleagues support me? Will my colleague see me as competition or fear receiving blame and be cut-throat about it? Will I pass the next round of layoffs? Does my manager even think I am smart/capable/have potential? Will I ever grow/progress in my career? Will my manager/colleagues remember all of my accomplishments or only fixate on any bugs or negative feedback?\n\nHow do you deal with these anxious/worrisome thoughts?",

Makes me feel I have to be a perfectionistic robot\u00a0*and*\u00a0perfectly manage every single interaction I have with a senior colleague to earn his approval.\n\n>He means well.\n\n>It\u2019s just striving for perfection leads to anxiety. I become more focused on what all can go wrong than what is going well. It can be a good mindset to have as an engineer, but it does make me more anxious.\n\nWhen I first joined my company, I had a rigorous manager, but in hindsight, it was one of the best things that could have happened to me. It helped me build a strong foundation that will serve me well in my career. You always have to be thinking about how these moments can make you a stronger engineer.\n\n>You seem like a caring thoughtful feedback giver. Your colleagues are lucky to work with you!\n\nThanks so much! :D",

I think I would enjoy pure computer science but I worry a lot of it would be made much more competitive where less devs are needed due to AI, espescially software engineering. Its already extremely competitive as is. I enjoy physics but I find it much harder than maths or CS, so I think electrical engineering would be more difficult for me but I feel like future job prospects might be better (espescially with renewable energy sources, evs and demand for hardware with AI.\n\nI also really enjoy lower level aspects of computer science like how storage devices function, cpu architecture, assembly and lower level languages like c++ and embedded systems (but I do not enjoy robotics). This makes me think computer engineering might be a good fit, but courses for that are very scarce in the 2 countries i can study (uk and nl) and it also seems limiting for going more into cybersecurty/software engineering/machine learning/more abstract side of cs which I also really enjoy. \n\nMost of my computer science so far has been programming and projects of my own which I really enjoy and I really enjoy logic problems and the feeling of solving something you were stuck on for ages, so i guess that leans more towards pure CS\n\nWhat degree would be better?

This may be short term analysis subject to change but still something to check.\n\nInterviews. CS is notorious for endless rounds that go nowhere. Is that the case for hardware, and how's the prep for that, what's needed.\n\nJob security. CS is quite hit or miss. What about hardware. Will robots come for that eventually to automate everything factory style?\n\nWhat are the hours on average. Are you going to be working long hours in hardware?\n\nWhat about the benefits.

Had another company I didn't remember applying to reach out to me.\n\n\"You know Unity?\" \"You familiar with X,Y,Z?\" \"Can't you tell us the difference between this and that?\" --- again, no coding assessment.\n\nHired. 75k/yr. Got raised to 80k after 6mo. Worked there a couple of years, fully remote. Was basically the guy in charge of the front end of the project.\n\nLayoffs happen.\n\nIt's been a little over two years.

I was thinking of doing a MS in finance after graduation but i heard that its very competitive and have long working hours. Is that true? Should i still go for it or continue studying CSE? But are there any fields in tech that require minimal or no coding at all! What about cloud computing or data sci? Are they minimal coding and high pay? Im open to learn. Im hardworking i just want to figure out what to actually go forward it. \nPlease help! Thank you all!",

I dont like coding at all. I was thinking of doing MS in AI or smthg but not sure anymore. I do have alot of interest in banks. I was thinking of doing a MS in finance after graduation but i heard that its very competitive and have long working hours. Is that true? Should i still go for it or continue studying CSE? But are there any fields in tech that require minimal or no coding at all! What about cloud computing or data sci? Are they minimal coding and high pay? Im open to learn. Im hardworking i just want to figure out what to actually go forward it. \nPlease help! Thank you all!",

Go do masters (costs 20k usd annually) in the US and actively look for an employer that\u2019s willing to sponsor my green card.\n2. Go to Germany on a job sponsoring my blue card from the beginning.\n\nOf course the Germany option seems more stable since I will be having a well-paying stable job from day 1 but it comes with trade offs like the need to learn German as quick as possible, and deal with how Germans treat foreigners specially since I am a person of color, and making significantly less money than what I can make in the US.\n\nThe trade offs at the US are that I don\u2019t like the lifestyle at the US, expensive healthcare and education, and car-centeric cities, and higher criminality rates, and probably worse work-life balance. And also, very far from home so it might be challenging to maintain social relationships at my home country. But the most important problem is, it will be a must to find a job that sponsors my green card or H1B or else I will have paid an enormous amount of money and possibly got in a huge debt for nothing.\n\nI read so many bad reviews about German tech market on reddit and much praise for the US. Do you agree with that?\n\nDoes anyone have an experience that can guide me where I should go? Does any of the trade offs I mentioned above have a higher weight that can lead to a decision?\n\nThank you!\n",

In Germany english is a bit less widespread but not by much and you will be able to get around with english just fine.\n\nIt seems to me that starting in Germany and mabe transitioning later in your career to the US is the safest option. You can avoid the risk of being in debt and not finding anything, start earning money immediatly and if you switch in 2-3 years you will have no additional debt, some savings and the same US salary (without masters, but with job experience)",

I went to the University of Toronto and got a degree in stats but I had been coding since highschool and I only got a stats degree because \"Big data\" was the big buzzword when I was going into uni which is mostly stats based so I did that to \"future proof\" myself. Right out of uni I couldn't get a job for like a year due to covid and with me not having a cs degree, I couldn't get much interviews but eventually on my second interview, I passed with colors and I joined a startup and I've been there almost 4 years.\n\nI understand the job market is tough right now and I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I'm making close to 6 figures in Toronto but I'm just not satisfied. I also know that my company is going to be sold in 1-2 years so I need to start thinking about what I want to do after.\n\n# Question\n\nI'm basically trying to see if there's any other fields that I can potentially switch into, which utilizes my skillset and pays just as much if not more than as an engineer. The obvious answer to make more money is to stay in the software engineering field but I just hate leetcode style questions with a passion but sadly that's needed to get into those companies that pay the big bucks. I'm terrible at remembering algorithms and while I believe myself to be a very good engineer, I just suck at leetcode. I can tackle easy/mediums pretty effortlessly but hard questions are pretty difficult for me.\n\nNow, on to what I am good at. \n\n* I'm good at thinking about issues big picture, so more geared towards system design I guess? I find system design really interesting so I've watched a lot of videos on how twitter, fb, doordash, etc, were made so I'm pretty good at coming up with cost effective solutions that balance scalability and ease of use. I've built quite a few full stack apps that I host on my own Hetzner VPS and I've set everything up from scratch and have had no issues\n* I'm also not a terrible coder. I constantly google and chatgpt everything (which I think is a skill in it's own right) but I've never come across an issue that I haven't been able to solve. I actually used to take a leetcode style approach to everything where I would try to optimize algorithms as much as possible till I was told that sometimes while the N^2 approach is definitely worse than N, it really doesn't matter if N is only 10 (basically our company at it's core is just doing CRUD operations on a DB, so stop trying to over engineer things and just do it cleanly and quickly)\n* **And where I shine the most**, I have incredible soft skills and great communication. Everyone in my company thinks so and I'm constantly the person that explains the technical things to the business people. Maybe it's because I'm an idiot but usually when our engineers and management speak, it's chaos till I come in and explain everything to both sides in a way that they understand. I'm also not awkward at all (which I know is a stereotype with engineers) and my people skills are top notch imo\n\n\nI do enjoy what I do, and I'm proud that I joined a startup very early on and with only 2 engineers (me and CTO), we've built it into a platform that is actually generating a decent amount of money, (and maybe this is because we're a remote company) but I really don't see myself being good at leetcode and grinding for a SWE job where I'm just working on a codebase and barely interacting with people and just slaving away at tickets.\n\nAlso even though I have a stats degree, I haven't done anything stats related in 4 years so I have 0 memory of anything stats related so don't read too much into that.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read this!",

        "content": "Delay graduating to get an internship?\nHi yall, I\u2019m currently in my theoretical last year of my cs degree. I have 3 classes to be completed (1 GE, 1 major, and the capstone) where 1 is a class, 1 will be a cleo test and the capstone is currently an incomplete grade so I have flexibility to finish it this or next semester. I\u2019m wondering if delaying my graduation a semester or 2 would be a wise move? I do not currently have any internship experience and only have my capstone as a completed project, the others are barely started but are solid ideas. In my circumstances, would it be more reasonable to graduate and go all in on new grad jobs? or instead stay in school while maybe moving home/working in order to continue to apply to internships, and maybe some new grad jobs as well? I switched to CS in 2022 so while im not \u201cnew\u201d i didn\u2019t have a solid foundation, and it\u2019s taken me longer to do my due diligence on stuff like leetcode and internships than it shoulda, so i just kinda feel a bit lost for direction but scared if i move forward i\u2019ll lose opportunities. any insights would be super appreciated ty!!",

        "content": "internship remote vs hybrid justeat?\nI have two path to choose and im really struggling. I've been searching and applying since october and given the market state, i don't want to back sending CV again everyday. I have two options in London.\n\nI have passed all the hiring steps with this startup and they offer me an intership to see how the things will go for 6 months with the lowest pay possible, but as they stated they work in sprint and i can arrange my workload as i prefer. so im not forced to clock in a certain time but just to deliver within the sprint. It's remote, so i can work at my parents house (not in london tho, but close). After 6 months, based on performance, they could hire me with a range that goes from the lowest possible ever, lower than the average in london till one of the highest. But it could be all bullsh\\*it. Pro: i can arrange my time, remote. so no need to do 1 hour of traveling to work and back home everyday (because if i want to save up i need a cheap rent = live away from the office). Cons: what if after 6 months \"yeah yeah u did well but at tthe moment the company is in a tight space.. we can offer this low paid salary.. sorry\" and im back to send CV again? Also this startup it's new, it doesn't have weight on the CV, same as my previous 3 years of work in a unknown startup that promised me a lot of things and never did. im feeling PTSD here. But i must admit, the arrangment of time and remote is quite interesting. They let me be a digital nomad tho\n\nIm also doing interviews with just eat in london. But they offer me a hybrid work: 3 days in office, 2 remote. they asked what salary im looking for and i said \"X\" but then they proposed me something slightly lower. btw it's an average salary for a junior tho. but in this case im forced to move to london, find a place to rent, travel to work (like everybody) and at the end of the month i would save less than the internship. But at least just eat has some weight on the CV and i can job hopping in the future. But im still in the hiring process and i don't know if i will reach the end tho\n\n  \nI think that having a remote job is a rare gem in this days. everybody wants it and im really close to achieve it. But as you know, if you stay at the company the salary will raise slowly compared to a job hopping.\n\n  \nWhat do you suggest? Bet everything on the startup and if everything failed, i go back to send CV again, hoping next year will be easier, or refuse the juicy trap of remote job, and focus on just eat to have a nice company name in my CV for the future?",

        "content": "8-9 months to prepare a PhD application in ML from a math background, is it possible?\nHi, this may be an unusual post, but I come from a Pure Mathematics background (analytic number theory) and I am going to be enrolled in a year-long masters in applied mathematics where i will be able to take quite a few ML courses. I initially wanted to do a PhD in pure math, but I want to pursue my further studies in Machine Learning now. Really, this decision comes not only after actually doing research in pure mathematics and seeing how poorly you get funded, how poor the job prospects are, and what it ends up amounting to (nothing tangible that anybody else will care about), but also after looking at\u00a0[AlphaGeometry](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/)\u00a0and current efforts at training LLMs to do mathematics. I had a big change of heart after consulting with a lot of professors and students in ML/Pure Math, and I've now decided that I want to work on this because it could very well cause a revolution in math. Indeed, I cannot say I am passionate about ML in and of itself yet (as I have not even studied it), but I am very passionate about what it can be applied to, and I think I have a background that gives me an edge with working in some of these applications (it helps to have done research in math if you wish to train AI to do research in math).\n\nThe only way it can be possible to pursue research in this is through a PhD program in ML, and those largely have deadlines in December/January (I'm NA). I did not take any computer science courses past my 3rd year (so just basic CS, DSA, Numerical Methods, no ML yet but I'll be picking that up over the summer) but I have a strong background in math, and especially in probability (random matrix theory specifically, due to its connection with analytic number theory). The only publication I have is in pure math as well, and I have a perfect GPA with many graduate courses in analysis/probability.\n\nHow do I prepare a strong application for a PhD in ML then? I have 8 months, and I take it that I cannot get a paper out so quickly, let alone one that makes it in a top conference but is it still possible to have a strong application? I guess, what I mean to ask is: is there space for students with a strong mathematics background that may be lacking in the ML side of things to pursue a PhD in ML? Or is the expectation that given how competitve things are, largely only those who have strong preparation with a longer background in ML specifically will be able to make it. Would it be wiser for me to try to get a job in the industry first then, and then apply after I work on some research projects there?\n\n**TLDR: Pure math student who wanted to do a pure math PhD now wants to do an ML PhD but has only 8 months to pick up on ML and prepare an application, what should he do**",

Many of us are now unemployed, facing layoffs, taking salary cuts and enduring grueling work environments to try and get through the worst tech recession since 2008.\n\nI myself now work in a fusty, old and stable government department in Europe.\n\nBut I once worked for a couple of 2010s ZIRP startups. And what places they were.\n\nPeople from across Europe and the world would rock up to these places and bring their seductive cocktail of cultural insight, experiences and languages. And they were motivated primarily to create something new and cool. The types who would have hated the fusty corporate offices that many of us now flee to in search of job security.\n\nAnd the energy was explosive. Sure most of their companies didn't make much profit or, in many cases, even revenue - but the magic was palpable. Not least because the company socials brought together so many people from different cultures and countries.\n\nLove, friendships (and even startup founder partnerships) were forged in these places. And this magic was often sparked overseas at global socials that the startups flew everyone to so that we could all party in foreign lands. I myself was flown to New York alongside everyone else in the London office to party for three days. It was crazy.\n\nMuch of that magic was captured in photographs that disappeared not long before those bankruptcies were declared.\n\nMany of those people have since moved on to more sensible lives, corporate jobs and the bright beginnings of early middle age.\n\nBut for a moment, it was magic.",

I have a friend's friend there (making a lot because he joined at the bottom in 2022) and that person also regularly works till 11 pm. It's REALLY bad there. Too many toxic teams at DoorDash. And the tech stack sucks there.\n\n(presuming stock doesn't fall/move).\n\nDoorDash pays slightly better but Amazon has better WLB (which isn't saying much in the first place). DoorDash has calibrations which is the same as what Amazon does. So the whole PIP argument is stupid there.",

        "content": "Basic academic knowledge for a SWE career switch for a non-CS background\nMy career is a bit of a long and winding road.  Academically, I started in Psychology (BS, MS) then went for a PhD in Neuroscience, and a MS in Applied Statistics.  From there I started working as a Data Scientist, and now I'm a Data Engineer in FAANG.  I have 5 years of experience as a DE and was recently promoted to staff DE.\n\nMy career has driven by frustration: always starting from a user of tools to fixer to developer.  I'm completely self-taught on programming through practical usecases I ran into with open source software.\n\nAs a middle-aged woman with a non-CS background in an increasingly competitive job market, I'm worried about my future career perspective.  I'm now in an ideal position to make a lateral move within my current job from DE to SWE, and cover more ground in the job market.  I'm sure I can get the interview and I already do a lot of SWE work, so I'm also not worried about the job. But I'm worried about my lack of academic knowledge and its potential impact on my interview.  For example I have a vague idea of what depth vs breadth first is, but not in a structured way.   I don't know what a declarative language is.  Etc. I love studying, so I was thinking of taking a few classes.  The goal is not getting credentials, but getting the academic knowledge.\n\n1. **Platforms:** What are the main online course platforms these days?  10 years ago I took ML classes on coursera.  Is that still one of the leading platforms?  \n2. **Classes:** What would be core classes I should take to fill in the gaps of fundamentals in CS?  I have the math/stats/ML part already covered through my stats degree. Data Structures and Algorithms?  Anything about systems design? \n3. **Languages:** I have a really good base in python and SQL.  I've written javascript, hack/Php, java, but couldn't do it without linter.  Was thinking of practicing leetcode on those for learning the syntax.  Should I also learn C/go?",

Reading big tech engineering blogs can also help you familiarize with what big tech companies actually do in the real world.\n\nFor the latter, there are many options, such as Harvard CS50, but you generally want to complement with self study (e.g. using platforms like Leetcode, or other forms of practical application such as creating DSA implementation repos). Reading open source implementations can also help.\n\nFor languages, C is appropriate if your goal is to learn about computer architecture as it pertains to software engineering (e.g. how memory usage maps to hardware limitations and why that matters). If you already know mainstream languages, picking up other mainstream languages isn't that difficult, since a lot of concepts transfer over. Go is one of the easiest languages to learn and doesn't really teach you any new thinking paradigms in the same way that, say, Haskell or Rust or Common Lisp might. It isn't necessary to learn those latter kinds of languages, but they may be of interest if you like the idea of refining the craft (and they can help you do so in much the same way some types of physical exercise target muscles that you never use).",

In the process I have a positive response for one of the european based company (Fineos) which is offering me permanent WFH which would reduce my travelling stress (I usually have to travel 30km to reach my office) also give me more comfort to up-skilling my knowledge. Now with that said.. \nHow safe is it to join companies like this? Coz I'm targeting to work for next couple years (atelast 4)\nI got a positive vibe when I had my interview.  \nI'm clueless about european companies. Also, the shift time they give me here is so perfect that I don't have to work in night shifts!\n\nI kindly seek help from you all to provide some inputs that I can make a decision.  ",

How? \n\n\\- The advertisement for the job has key words and phrases laced throughout the post.  An algorhythm searches your resume for key words chosen by the hiring manager.  If your resume doesn't include the exact key words then your resume likely is not presented by the internet job board for consideration to the employer.\n\n\\- Study the job description and make your best guess at the key words. Some job descriptions on the job board even give you a list of key words at the end of the advertisement.\n\n\\- Tweak your resume to include the key words that match the particular job you are applying for.\n\n**list measurable outcomes achieved in former jobs**\n\n\\- Instead of listing skills in your resume try listing metrics, measurable outcomes, and successes in your past jobs. Give examples of what you have accomplished and explain how the accomplishment solved a problem for the employer. For example, the job description mentions that the employer is seeking a new employee who can mutlitask handling several separate businesses in a complex changing environment.  Your resume should read: Leader of a team of 5 responsible for the accounting for 9 affiliated organizations  All 9 organizations were audited annually with no material finding. \n\n**functional resumes hide employment history gaps.**\n\n\\- if you have gaps in your work history try a functional resume. List the lessons learned, skills learned and used to solve the former employers problems.\n\n**go light on listing soft skills**\n\n\\- go light mentioning soft skills, while important, the hiring manager would rather read about your demonstrated ability to solve problems. \n\n  \nThe first vetting of resumes will exclude all but the top candidates.

I used to have dreams of doing something with music (I did all state jazz band in high school, piano player of the top band), but since COVID and having to move my life has been really fucked up. I\u2019m not playing piano anymore and I don\u2019t have any friends or career opportunities that are motivating. I would also really like to have a chance at actually having a normal college experience and getting a decent degree that would lead to a stable job. \n\nIm thinking of just saving up money to do welding school, because I\u2019ve had a job where I got to watch welders and it looked pretty cool. I\u2019m also familiar with working in heavy equipment environments. Is there any thing else that would offer a path to retirement? I\u2019m planning on killing myself at some point, if there\u2019s no way to retire, which does looks likely, even given the fact that I\u2019m pretty much done even thinking about playing music and am only set on working manual labor jobs until I die. \n\n\nThanks.

I dont know why it was pushed so hard on kids that they could do anything, because frankly the world needs more welders and CNC machiners than musicians. Being a rockstar comes with its own drawbacks, see Layne Stanley and Kurt Cobain for more details. Welding means a ton of travel though, I have family who are welders in oklahoma and east texas, it is a very location dependant industry but you can make alot of money. I also have family making 30$ an hour to haul sand with their CDL in east texas. \n\n2. Why kill yourself? Get a family and dedicate your life to raising your children and fuck even if youre broke and old you can live with your kids and help them raise their children. Its a fucked up world and you just have to make your way through it. Turn to God and seek him, find purpose with your life. \n\n3. Maybe join the military, I rolled the dice when I was 21 and it worked out for me, I'm retired with a great va rating and this recession is bearable, though certainly not comfortable. If I was still in it wouldnt matter, checks come on the first and the 15th come hell or high water I was getting paid. Seems like if I thought I was going to end it all over fear of being broke and old the military would be a reasonable option. Plus they pay for my healthcare, for life.",

There are tons of videos on YouTube about it.  Obviously won\u2019t be able to use the one at work to make your own stuff (unless they allow for that). Bringing an additional understanding shows initiative and fully understanding a process could open doors to move up. There comes a point in a career where your formal education really doesn\u2019t matter because you have attained the position, title, and handled the responsibilities associated with certain processes that inherently credit you for being skilled in whatever it is that you\u2019re doing. \n\nThe people that created stuff like battery and first photographs were not electricians nor chemist, but hobbyists .\n\nI also went to college for Art (not music but I understand what you\u2019re going through to an extent). I feel like what I studied is almost entirely irrelevant to what I do today, but that being said, I found a way to make it work in my favor.\n\nI do not know what they make at this place that you work at, but I\u2019m sure that you can transfer whatever knowledge that you learn about this machine it\u2019s processes, etc. into something that you know about music (depending on how certain materials and how they are rendered/made they\u2019ll have different resonance, this can help in the inspection for integrity, not all flaws can be seen)\n\nNeed to be careful with weed, especially if you\u2019re going to become a welder or work with any heavy machinery of any kind. I know someone who works in or who did work in construction who got injured (minor explosion) and they faulted him cause he was stoned, so no pay out for him\u2026 also with the gases and such that are used in welding or even the release of vapor from TIG welding may have a negative impact on your health so you need to protect yourself. Same can be said about CNC processes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in heavy machinery, and such, perhaps look into becoming a longshoreman  if you can find any vacancy and will provide work in a single place, if you go into construction, you risk being moved around, but crane operators seem to make a lot of money. I don\u2019t know about these days, but I remember hearing something about that, that does mean travel, though. \n\nI encourage you to still play music as a source of getting out energy and expression. If it\u2019s not too painful\u2026I had a traumatic event during the pandemic and it kept me away from art for a long time, sorrow has a funny way of doing that, but eventually, we let go. \n\nTry not to drink too much\u2026it\u2019s only gonna rob you of time, money, health \u2026.",

Every new job situation is a *potential* opportunity to reset the clock.  Obviously, when you stay with the same employer, you lose some leverage, because they know your old compensation, and if they are one of those places that think there can't be big jumps, then they will try to give you flack like you are getting now.\n\nIn your situation -- and because of this job market -- unless you are prepared to go and get a job with an entirely different employer, I would happily take this jump, and look to push for more come end of year.  You clearly have a manager that will support you, and you can use the time between now and then to see how the overall job market is and get a sense of your options.\n\nDon't jeopardize everything in a fight right now.  Your new manager already fought for right now, so only push it if you can afford to risk it.   (Don't assume that \"no\" is the only negative answer you could end up with this time.)\n\nDon't get blinded by the potential of the top end, that you lose the current advantage outright.  This is most likely going to be more successful as a two-part fight, and as a one-part fight.\n\nThe idea that failing to negotiate today means that you lose permanently from here on it, is just silly on the face of it.  Your next negotiation need not be based on the parameters of this one at all.  (Harder to do when you stay with the same employer, but it's still a separate negotiation activity.\n\nAll the best to you in this new role.   Keep an eye on the job market, and the market rates for the work you are doing, and start testing the waters so see what your options for year end will be.",

        "content": "How to not lose hope when job hunting\nI graduated from university this gone July with a 1st (GPA 4.0 I believe) in Computer Science with an AI specialty. Since graduation, I have applied for somewhere just over 100 jobs in data science, ML engineering, etc. without the faintest degree of interest from any of them. \n\nApplications vary from simply sending in a CV to completing coding tests, homework exercises, and the likes. However, despite the hours that I can end up putting into some applications, I've never had any actual feedback beyond the standard copy-paste rejection, despite me almost always asking for some.\n\nMy biggest issue is definitely my lack of work experience. I have a few years across various hospitality roles, but nothing even remotely in the ballpark of my field of study. I have a GitHub where I post personal projects to try and partly make up for that, but I'm not sure how much that's helping...\n\nThe university has helped me get my CV into a good state, and sometimes I can get some help from them with specific applications. They're generally helpful, but there's only so much they can do.\n\nI'm tired of working in a pub. I didn't imagine 4 years of working my ass off, amassing \u00a380k in debt (and a \u00a32000 overdraft that's rapidly gaining interest, yet I'm unable to pay a penny back in my current situation) would leave me in the same jobs I had at 16. \n\nI want to keep trying, but every application is draining me more and more, and now when I get home and look at LinkedIn or any other job boards, I'm filled with dread and often close my laptop out of exhaustion before I can muster the energy for a single application. How can I keep myself motivated, keep applying for jobs despite the overwhelming tax it has on my sanity? \n\nTldr; how can a melodramatic CompSci graduate maintain motivation to apply for jobs after 100+ unsuccessful applications?",

I start a class to get my CDL on May 28th. It\u2019s a 5 week class. My Mother-In-law is dead set on me getting a job before my class. I haven\u2019t had one in 8 years so what\u2019s a few more months. My logic is if I was an employer I wouldn\u2019t want to hire someone, (who knows they will be quitting in 2 months) to train them, take time out of other people\u2019s lives to show them what to do just for them to quit. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to the actual company I don\u2019t believe. My mother in law hates my guts just for reference. She even said she would take a week off from work to help me find a job today at Sunday dinner in front of the whole family. She was like so do I need to take a week off to help you find a job? Then I have an appointment on April 4th with my dermatologist and I have an appointment with the dmv to take my permit test for my cdl which I have to take prior to starting the class and I have to take a cdl physical so that\u2019s like 3 days of work I\u2019d potentially miss at my new job. Any advice on this situation would help. I have a job lined up for when I finish my class in july.  I\u2019ll be working with a construction company hauling dirt. My husband is a crane operator so he makes really good money as well ( hence why I haven\u2019t had a job in 8 years) any advice? Please be kind\u2026.. ",

I started in January. I might have to leave sooner because my supervisor and the HR lead are abusive and unfairly targeting me, and the work environment is toxic, and I have a lot on my plate right now. I'm gonna try to move to a different department and ride it out until May 1st just so it doesn't look bad and so I get to utilize an employee discount (which they don't give until after 90 days), which I can't do until April 9th. If I'm in danger of getting fired, I may have to resign while I have the chance.\n\nBefore, in my senior year of high school, I worked for my school district in a career-exploration internship type path, doing different jobs, from June 2023 until my last day of classes last year in May. I then got a summer internship at a laboratory from June-August of last year. I figure listing Walmart on my resume isn't important, especially if I'm expected to be a college student during this time. While it does show my customer skills, I wouldn't want my future employers contacting the HR lead or my department's current supervisor, as they would NOT leave a good reference. The store's manager and the 2 sub-supervisors are good though, as well as the previous supervisor of the department. What should I do?",

For full transparency, I have already posted this in r/chemistry but would love some additional input!\n\nSo, this coming Monday I have an interview for an analytical chemistry position which I am simultaneously excited and terrified for! Essentially, I graduated back in May of 2022 and experienced some health issues so I wasn't able to get an in-person job in my field, however, I've managed to secure an interview, but now I feel like I literally know nothing and I am terrified of the types of technical questions they will ask me.\n\nThe job description mentions things like: HPLC, spectrophotometry, classical wet chemistry, microscopy, etc.\n\nNow, I have experience with all of the above, however, it has been a hot minute since I've actually done them. Since securing the interview I've been refreshing myself on concepts, particularly the basics of chromatography, titrations, spectrophotometry, etc. but honestly, my mind goes completely blank as soon as I start thinking of computations because I haven't done them in years. And when I say blank, I mean it, like, it takes me a while to do even the most basic of computations. Essentially, I feel that I could explain the basics of the concepts I mentioned, but I don't know I can do much more than that. The thing is, I know the concepts and am very eager to learn and/or re-learn what I don't know/remember, but I don't want to come across as a dummy in the interview. I know I'll be fine once I've had additional practice.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to prepare or types of questions I should review? Thank you!",

But some things were lied to me before starting (such as having a work life balance.) I've only been here for 2 months and already dreading it is a massive red flag for me. I'll stick out a shitty job, but shitty management is making life a hell.\n\nI dread going into work every day. I like the job itself, the people I can't stand. They overwork us (45-50 hours mandatory every week), they over schedule clients, they're passive aggressive, and I feel pretty isolated not being able to properly take care of my dogs and see my girlfriend. \n\nThe schedule is ass. I can't even make time to go into the DMV or take time off for myself because they're so strict about everything to the point where they try to fully guilt trip you into not using your PTO. I've been sick this week but I've been having literal fever dreams about this place. \n\nI've been looking for other work but given the current job market, I don't know if I can find suitable replacement for work and I'm worried. What can I do to cope with working 7-5pm, having to wake up at 4am just to make the commute, and only having a couple of hours every day once I'm home?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

There are many reasons why I needed to leave, but over the past year and a half, things have gotten progressively worse, and I can't deal with the toxicity anymore. Back in September, we had a new CEO start with us, and he brought his wife along, who was hired shortly after. She has no idea about what she's doing, and it has been very difficult working alongside someone who has absolutely zero experience in this position or even our industry. She does not want to do any work, but she wants to tell 3 of us what to do, even though we do not report to her. She does a lot of pretending that she knows what to do, almost like she's playing office.  I had also been threatened to play very nice and to show excitement over her ideas, or else I might lose my job. When my resignation was announced on Friday, I received a long email from her begging me to explain why I'm leaving the company, telling me she's loved working together, begging me to please stay, what can she do to make me stay and how can she make things work for me. I realize it's probably because she knows that she's going to actually have to start doing work, which she doesn't want to do, and she also doesn't know how to do. What is the most appropriate way to respond to her question professionally? I know if I don't respond, she will continue to barrage me with emails, like she always does when I don't get back to her in five minutes.",

A couple of days later before putting my CV to the hiring manager asked, told me that she\u2019s been told that they can\u2019t offer me my current salary and this was going to be about 5k less than what I was currently getting. She also took details of my global client experience.\nI had my interview with the hiring manager on Friday who has offered me the role verbally ( waiting for official letter). However he told me that there are two roles going - one for 6 year global experience and one advance role with 8 years experience, the recruiter had actually put me forward for a less experienced role ( I think it was an error rather than deliberate from her side), she had put down 6 years of global experience. I actually have 11 years global experience and manager was more than happy to offer me the advanced one based on my experience.\n\nNow question is how do I negotiate this salary because they know redundancies are going on in some departments and I assume she will see me as \u2018desperate\u2019 which I am to be fair. \nI am not expecting anything magnificent but at least what I am currently getting and not a salary cut \ud83d\ude1e\n\nAny advice how I can negotiate on it please?

I joined the team as a part-time employee in late 2023, and have remained somewhat stagnant in that position until recently. In December, my coworker (the manager of my department,) left in pursuit of new opportunities, and I have since taken on their workload which I have been managing with no additional hours. Initially, my former manager quietly told me not to apply for their role, as the hiring team was searching for an external hire with more experience. As the organizations luck would have it, the candidate that they extended the managerial role to has since declined, which has left us back at square one.\n\nNow that I have obtained experience handling the job duty requirements and have met the expectations of what the manager position entails, I would like to be considered as an applicant.\n\nI am curious if any folks here may have insight into how I may broach this topic professionally. I have been working on updating my portfolio with external freelance/contract projects, as well as obtaining new certifications that would build up my resume. If any of you have found yourself in a similar situation, I would love to hear your experience!\n\nThank you in advance!\n(So sorry for the vagueness.

        "content": "Atypical job offer\nCompany in my field in a neighboring city is offering me an assistant position with a supposed opportunity for advancement in about a year for pay in the six figure range. They claim that their professionals work 40-45 hrs per week and are interested in growing in areas I\u2019m interested in. Already kinda sounds too good to be true.\n\nThe biggest caveats are they want me to relocate in a month and are saying work will be picking up w lot in 2 weeks, and they want me to have a car by the time I start there. \ud83d\ude43 I don\u2019t currently own a car and am trying to remain as stable as possible after a layoff round that I lost my job in. So realistically I don\u2019t expect to be able to afford a car for awhile even with a good paying job. On top of that, without too many details, I am in the process of getting my driver\u2019s license and it\u2019s taking longer than expected from a third party to work through a filing process. This company was encouraging me to buy a car without a license and telling me how to become insured without one. I asked if I could drive one of the company\u2019s vehicles for business related tasks and they said that would be a huge liability to drive their vehicles without a license. I told them I won\u2019t be driving without a license no matter what. Also, the company\u2019s located in a suburban area with the closest public transit being a 30 min walk away and multifamily housing in that area is very limited and expensive at the moment.\n\nAnyway, should I run away and turn down the offer, or is it still worth considering in the current state of the economy? Not really sure what to tell them when they send their offer yet. They just seem kinda desperate and their suggestion that I drive illegally put out red flags.",

        "content": "Am I making a mistake?\nI currently manage a store Id rather not mention the name of the business but I\u2019ve worked my way up from the bottom all the way from the top in the past 8 years. My job is very high stress but I feel I manage well. I was recently approached by a former employer wanting me to take a position at a different company. As far as compensation it\u2019s about the same money with about 6 hours less of work a week but it also comes with full benefits which my current job does not offer. I feel those are important as I\u2019m getting older and the cost of health insurance in the US is a joke. The issue is facing is I love most aspects of job, my clients, my crew and have built a good reputation for myself in my community at the same time. The problem I\u2019m having is ownership and I feel like I\u2019ve hit a ceiling there. The owner of the business is very unappreciative of the work I put in and doesn\u2019t compensate me appropriately when you look at similar positions in the field. I\u2019m pretty demotivated because outside of the day to day I don\u2019t have any goals now that I\u2019ve peaked there. This other job has room to grow, move up and obviously far less stress for the time being because I wouldn\u2019t be management (would be interested in getting back into eventually if the pay is right). I guess I\u2019m just looking to see if anyone has ever been in a similar situation for advice because my current job is the one I\u2019ve had for the majority of my adult life and to be honest it terrifies me going into uncharted waters. Thank you for your time. \n\nTLDR: I think I need change but I\u2019m scared like hell to go to a different job ",

It officially counted as a resignation rather than a firing, but the bottom line was they let me go over performance issues. \n\nPart of me wants to leave it off my resume going forward for obvious reasons, but I'm worried it will come up in a background check or if they ask me if I've ever been forced to resign from a position. I have several years of experience in the industry with another company before I ended up in that place, and it went fine. Should I still include it?",

I've been with this company for 7 years and I know the people and procedures well. The work is not as tough as we have a lot of IT personnel globally to spread the workload.. The only downside is that it can get pretty lonely as I do not have face to face interaction with my peers. Then again, its zero office politics. Because of WFH, i found time for fitness regime, go for long runs  and managed to shed 10kgs in past 5 years.\n\nI've recently gone through 3 rounds of interview with with another MNC company. The role is for Senior Azure cloud engineer, but it also involves cloud architecture. They do not have as many IT staff as my current job. For this one, its totally work from office 5 days a week. The commute would be 1 hour each way via subway. The expected salary would be 142K per annum including bonus.\n\nI'm debating if the additional 37K per annum is worth the move. I have calculated that I'd probably need to spend 6K per year for transport and food expenses. WFH has given me plenty of time with my wife and kids. I understand that if i take on this new role, i kiss goodbye to my WFH freedom and would have to spend more time with in office till probably 8pm 2-3 times a week, depending on projects.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAdditional notes -- I am turning 46 this year. So I'm not sure if any other company would want to hire an aging man within the next few years. Either I move now or I stay in current company and hold my peace.",

I even tried giving them super specific roles and the responses I got were laughably off-topic.\n\nThe worst part? **Customer support is non-existent**.

Can you apply for a credit card just to rent a super cheap motel room for a few weeks until your first paycheck comes in? You would definitely want to pay it off right away, but if you don't have a car to sleep in, I'm not sure of many other options that would allow you to make sure you get to work and do your best everyday.\n\nYou would want to save up your first few paychecks to rent a super cheap studio, then get reimbursed for any moving expenses you incur (not sure if this counts for the security deposit). A cheap studio would be cheaper than a motel room on a month to month basis, so the sooner you can get a studio, the better.",

And I'm good at it -- very good. My clients are well served, I'm on top of everything, and proactive when I can be. I have more knowledge of the industry we're in than most of my team. \n\nI'm not perfect by any stretch -- the remote helps my PTSD from a previous job, but it still impacts how I deal with conflict, and I have little tolerance for the interpersonal \"we're a happy family\" dynamics of my little team (less than 25 people total, about half of us are remote). I could be better at dealing with that, and I'm trying.\n\nThe problem is that my boss (anxious and micromanaging) keeps spouting off stupid buzzwords like \"bringing your authentic self\" and \"finding your passion\" like he just swallowed an HR textbook. And I hate every second of it. It's too personal, especially when he tries to fake being my friend. It immediately makes me anxious and stressed out, and when that happens my fight or flight kicks in. I DREAD our weekly 1-on-1 calls. \n\nAnd part of the reason it stresses me out so much is because he's so damn insincere. He doesn't want my \"authentic self,\" he wants me to be mega-happy so he can feel good about himself. \n\nIs there a way for me to politely and professionally tell him to back the f off?

I don't think I have the personality for sales, but I am indeed quite good at managing a team, operations, and helping frustrated people leave happy.\n\nI took an in-depth career quiz and it mostly suggested things I'd need an advanced degree for. I'm mulling on that. \n\nI want to bust out of where I am now (4045k/year and no benefits). I'd really like to be making at least 65k to get my life and goals and savings back on track after divorce emptied the piggy bank.\n\nI have no idea what jobs to look at because this was never the career trajectory I planned on.

I make $100k less than my colleagues at the same school when I teach more classes and have no benefits. \n\nI also left a career in business management (before I knew the academic market for full time, tenured jobs was going to crash). I spent years as the EOO and Director of Communications at a multimillion dollar private retail company and also several years in retail management at Apple. \n\nI\u2019m disabled, but previously only needed a cane. At that point I got to the final interview stage at (usually) 1-3 schools a year until I got a tenure-track job. Then budgets got cut, so I wasn\u2019t renewed, but have a glowing recommendation that states that was the only reason why I wasn\u2019t kept on. The RIF\u2019d almost 30 tenured professors the semester after I wasn\u2019t renewed. \n\nShortly after I was back on the market, I was hit by a student who lost control of their vehicle as I was exiting my legally parked car, heading in to teach. (The bs of the lawsuit failing isn\u2019t worth getting into.) Because of my existing issues, I then needed a motorized wheelchair. \n\nI now get interviews at schools I\u2019ve never taught at, but the second I have one face to face and they see the chair, I get turned down. \n\nAt schools I already teach at, I no longer even get screening interviews. But they\u2019re fighting to get me to teach their classes instead of taking contracts at other schools. \n\nI thought initially it was paranoia, but my partner is also a professor and is familiar with my job hunt before and after the chair. He said that it 100% is the problem. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to just get anything remote that\u2019s full time with benefits, but as this sub shows, it\u2019s rough. I get a lot of \u201cyou\u2019re overqualified\u201d responses. \n\nBut I just need a full time job with benefits. \n\nAny advice on trying to deal with discrimination you just have no way of proving in court? As in, getting hired when you can\u2019t hide the wheelchair?\n\nNote: I *can* walk short distances for very short times, but not enough to fake it for a full campus interview or anywhere that\u2019s not a pretty small office. And when I did get an administrative job after doing that, once they realized I couldn\u2019t do things not listed in the job description (pushing 200lb carts, etc.), they let me go with no reason given two days before the probation period ended.\n\n",

        "content": "Would you take a pay cut for a promotion?\nShould I take a pay cut for a promotion into management?\n\nHey everyone. Looking for some advice.\n\nI am a single male, no roommates and no debt. \n\nOver the last 2.5 years I\u2019ve been working towards moving into a management role at my company. I work for a private saas organization and I am at the highest point I can be as an individual contributor. There are no higher grades and the only reason to stay in this position is for the annual raise to my salary. \n\nHere\u2019s some background information. I am a Sr. CSM. In October I was promoted from Sr. CSM 3 to 4. The internal grade for this was a promotion from grade 7 to grade 8. This came with an 8% salary increase and a bump in my variable compensation from 20% to 25%. \n\nMy current salary is $150,400 with variable compensation of $37,600 for an OTE of $188,000.\n\nThe issue is the manager of CS role is a grade 7. So I would have to move down a grade after being \u201cpromoted.\u201d The salary band for this role is $105k-135k. My manager went to bat and got payroll to agree to the highest salary band for this grade which would be $145k.\n\nSo the promotion to management would be a $145,000 salary and $29,000 in variable compensation for an ote of $174,000.\n\nSo ultimately I would need to take a salary cut of $5,400 and a total OTE cut of $14,000 for this \u201cpromotion.\u201d\n\nI feel stuck. Other companies won\u2019t hire me into a management role because I don\u2019t have the experience. I certainly have been positioning myself and have things to speak towards that show I can fit into the position, but most companies don\u2019t care. So I either take a lateral position and start over at another company or I take this pay cut and lower grade to get the title. This would ultimately push me to leave in 6 months to a year for another management role and higher pay. \n\nI value having the title and new work. I am tired of the day to day monotony as an individual contributor. I would have 10 employees reporting to me. And while my workload would certainly increase the dynamic of my work would change which would definitely help. \n\nThe salary payout would equate to around $130 a paycheck which isn\u2019t a huge deal, but is frustrating to work towards this kind of bigger role and have to take a pay cut. \n\nWhat would you do? Interview for the role? Counter once you get an offer? What kind of counter should I ask for? Should I just call it quits and start looking for a lateral job with higher pay? \n\n\nSorry for the typos. ",

Why was I laid off and not others? Why does it seem so certain that I'll be renting apartments the rest of my life?\n\nHey all, subtle energy sociology guy here. I wrote an intro to this that you can check out by searching \"Economy of Envy.\" I'm here to give an energetic perspective on why some people are handed success and easy money \u2014 while others fight to simply exist.\n\nIt has nothing to do with talent. And everything to do with who's holding the reins.\n\nCheck out this subreddit, if you're new here. Click a few posts. Look at how some people can send out applications for months, or more than a year, with zero luck. Highly qualified candidates with plenty of experience in their field. Yet they are avoided by employers like the plague. Even Walmart and fast food evade them. Like they have a target on their heads.\n\nNow check out r/ salary. Had to add a space after the slash so the post doesn't get removed, just delete that space and place it in your Reddit search bar. Look at what some people get paid. Hundreds of thousands a year, many of them barely 30 years old. Invariably they mention something akin to \"networking\" being key to them having \"lucked out.\" Important keywords relating to what we're about to explore.\n\nLet's take a quick look into a few of the conventional ways people \"network and luck out\" before we get into the juicy stuff.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**\"We Promote Our Own\"**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's an easy one. Nepotism.\n\nMost of us assume it trends towards the obvious. A father placing his son in an elevated role, regardless of talent or skillset. Or a daughter, wife, husband, whoever. Pretty straightforward. We've seen this quite a bit, be it corporate or political. No one's surprised by this.\n\nLet's go a step further into what nepotism means. It includes family as well as friends and associates. Now who might that usually entail?\n\nLet's continue. Religion.\n\nIf you consider the legality of hiring based on religion, we understand that's usually a big no-no. You can't refuse someone based on their beliefs. But if you happen to share beliefs with a candidate, might you be somewhat warmer in your perception of them?\n\nI'm phrasing this lightly, for what I'm alluding to is anything but accidental.\n\nA resume isn't likely to mention religion but if you go to the same church, the same temple, the same unit of worship, you're fairly likely to be aware of each other.\n\nI grew up with a few Mormons who were some of my best friends all throughout my primary schooling. It was made apparent they will always hire, promote and enrich those who share their creed. Above anyone else. No matter what.\n\nThis was made crystal clear when Mitt Romney ran for President. These friends admitted bluntly, this is who we have to vote for. This is what's going to happen. It wasn't questioned in the slightest.\n\nI have nothing against Mormons. They're truly a kind bunch. This was simply the first time in my life I realized that people of certain belief systems relentlessly promote their own. Without question.\n\nLet's make this a little spicier. Consider Freemasonry.\n\nFreemasonry is not a fairy tale. The mere mention of it does not ensure that a conspiracy is to follow. Let's approach this in as grounded a way as we can.\n\nIn most every town and city in the country, if not the Western world, there is a Freemasonry lodge. If this sounds too outlandish to be true, I encourage you to use your favorite fact-finding tools to derive the truth of this claim. It's been around more than a few hundred years, long before the U.S. was ever founded.\n\nIt's widespread. This is reality.\n\nAt the most basic level of what Freemasonry is, even the most tight-lipped Mason will claim that it is nothing more than a drinking club for old farts (they love to downplay themselves). Where the wealthy and powerful congregate to \"build better men,\" as the slogan goes. You won't find a single Mason who claims otherwise. Sure sounds folksy, doesn't it.\n\nNow let's think for a moment. What potential is there in drinking and rubbing elbows with the wealthy and powerful in your community? Is there a chance that doing so might result in certain advantages for you?\n\nThe answer is, clearly, yes. Who would dispute it? Networking 101.\n\nThough there's something I should make clear about Freemasons in general.\n\nMasons work with stone. This goes all the way back to the masons of Solomon's Temple. The creation of mammoth temples and castles depends upon the expert placement of each and every stone. Freemasonry extends this notion and designates each and every person who joins to be a stone that builds upon one another. No matter how small a role you play, you are intrinsic to a solid foundation.\n\nAs such, there is a strong sense of solidarity and unison amongst their ranks. Not only because they share a common watering hole, but because it is the basis of their union. In a very literal sense.\n\nStones must be expertly carved and laid upon each other for the Grand Work to be completed.\n\nAs such, it is paramount that those under this umbrella work carefully place those who share their vision. In precisely the spots they need to be. As is the basic operating procedure of the premise.\n\nThese are not my theories. These are the tenets of Freemasonry.\n\nDo your own research. Or ask a Mason yourself. What I've shared here is nothing farfetched, concerning Masonic lore. I would be intrigued to see a Mason do the mental gymnastics required to reproach what I've shared with you today.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Reveal the Truth of your Peers through Energetic Analysis**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel I should throw in a tidbit of my own signature strangeness before we move on.\n\nAs I alluded to above, I am the \"subtle energy sociology\" guy. What that means is, I use a particular technology which is simple to make that allows one to map out the energetic dynamic of a particular person. All that's needed is for these individuals to share proximity with this tech for a moment or two.\n\nFreemasons of a high enough level have a very particular energetic signature, which a number of folks who engage with such technology have measured and corroborated. Which is pretty impressive if they're nothing more than a drinking club. For a drinking club to change your intrinsic energetic signature . . .  that would have to be one hell of a club.\n\nFreemasonry is but one of a plethora of \"fraternal\" cults that run rampant through our various societies. All of which endeavor to place their people throughout each and every industry. All such groups have their own signature frequencies, which can be measured by anyone with the proper tool and technique.\n\nSo I have to ask, if you find yourself curious. If I were to give you the tool and technique, would you dare to confirm my findings?\n\nWhat do you have to lose?\n\nWell, a lot, actually.\n\nBecause once you see the truth, the truth sees you back.\n\nTo some, that might be worth it. Because you'll know, the problem doesn't reside in you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Contemplation**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI wrote this post to get you thinking. Why are certain people chosen to be hired, promoted or simply not laid off over others?\n\nSome of these reasons are easy to accept. We've seen it in the news, our personal lives . . .\n\nOne such reason is nepotism.\n\nSome of them stand just outside the realm of the conventionally acceptable. This includes Freemasonry, the little big secret of how the movers and shakers choose who rises the ranks.\n\nIt's worth knowing that there are factors beyond your resume that determine who gets the job.\n\nBut it's so much more than that. There are factors at play which most would never guess at. Because the system we exist in is designed to have us blame ourselves, or capitalism, or anything but the core of the issue.\n\n\"You're not good enough. They're better than you. You're doing it wrong. The industry is rough.\"\n\nToo rough to hire you. But others, no problem.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nGuess they got lucky.\n\nWe're expected to accept any number of oft-repeated excuses as to why we cannot thrive, succeed or even live comfortably.\n\nThere's always an intangible boogeyman that makes it easy for us to accept our suffering. Something too far away to affect. An invisible ocean, the likes of which we can't help but be subjected to and seemingly have no hope of positively affecting. We're expected to face our families, our children, and parrot off these empty-sounding excuses that do nothing to soothe them.\n\nDo you ever wake up and feel a vice upon your heart?\n\nA noose around your future?\n\nIt's by design.\n\nIt's not a personal shortcoming. It's the hoped-for outcome of the system we find ourselves in. The innocents, the uninitiated are meant to writhe, to grieve, to struggle in the mud.\n\nOnly the chosen people are allowed comfort and luxury. Only those who have given themselves completely to . . .  well, if you know, you know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What's Next**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have one more post to make concerning this subject.\n\nI want to give you a way to see, affect, investigate this seemingly invisible ocean.\n\nThere's a way you can make the situation crystal clear. What's more, you can make it clear to everyone.\n\nYou can highlight a person's \"signature frequency\" and make them stand out to EVERYONE. Everyone with eyes to see will perceive there's something different about some of those who achieve elevated positions and fortune. Something we can't quite put our finger on but stands out from others in our circles.\n\nMake that artificiality apparent to all. If such an endeavor calls to you.\n\nDon't bury your head in the sand. Don't accept the blinders and willingly climb into your coffin. Trust your intuition. Feel into that depth. Your hunch is correct.\n\nSomething's up. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not lacking anything. You're genuinely worthy. I hope you feel this to be the truth.\n\nThere's an artificial economy of worth pulling the strings. The time has come to look it in the face.\n\nYou can make it tangible. If you want to.\n\nMore to come.",

I then sent a note back and said \"I am requesting 6 months\" since during one of our last meetings the CEO said \"I was from Eastern Europe and stupid\" - I normally don't care about people's idiotic comments about gender/race/origin etc. towards me but this time i did say I believed I had a claim given that I was fired the day after those comments were made. \n\n1) Would i get in trouble for writing articles and social media stuff about them and how horrible they are?\n\n2) Should I keep pushing for 6 months of severance or just take the 2 weeks and cut off ties?\n\n3) They are also a defense contractor and i could file a whistleblower inquiry since they way overcharge the government... \n\nAny ideas/opinion and particularly advice would be SO MUCH appreciated.

My job was initially to clean the church. Now I have to clean the church and the preschool building. It\u2019s a small building so it only takes me a few hours, however, since I\u2019ve started a couple months ago, a lot of extra duties have been added that are not cleaning related. I have posted a picture so you can see. All the duties that include getting the worship center ready for services have been added after we agreed to the terms in the beginning and were not discussed prior to being added. They just handed me a new checklist without discussing it. I\u2019m paid a flat rate of $75 each time I clean. I\u2019m having a hard time determining what is appropriate and how I should go about talking to them because I feel taken advantage of. I pretty much do everything my uncle is supposed to do as the pastor but without the large salary. He gets large boxes of stuff shipped to the church everyday and members of the church do as well and they just leave the boxes by the trash cans and tell me they need to be broken down and taken out to the dumpster. I also am now expected to do his dishes he leaves in the kitchen sink. This all seems inappropriate to me because I\u2019m not technically a W2 employee, I\u2019m a contractor so they really aren\u2019t supposed to be making me do stuff outside of cleaning.

I tend to get\u00a0very anxious, so any advice on managing nerves would also be super helpful.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts\u2014thanks so much in advance!\u00a0",

I am a safety professional but now I do invoicing, record keeping for insurance, get and review mail with some safety projects on the side but not much time to do them. \nI have a new opportunity that I believe will be better for me but this manager has waited a year to fill this role and apparently \u201creallly\u201d needs my help. I do not like her but I know you don\u2019t necessarily have to like your boss, but I pretty much dread being around her. And she micro manages me a bit. I\u2019m used to working much more independently. \nShould I feel guilt? Or should I just move on to the next?\n\nAlso context - I\u2019ve moved jobs a bit. This is my 7th job in 11 years. Most times I\u2019ve left either was because I needed to move or a toxic work environment. ",

                "content": "Many years ago I was in your shoes and I know it sucks but don\u2019t get down on yourself you will find something eventually. Try to use your time unemployed to stay physically active and doing your hobbies ( once you land a job you will have less time for those things and you will miss the freedom eventually). Make sure to spend a lot of time outside of the house with friends and family. Being unemployed and at stuck at your parents home all day will lead to depression fast. \n\nAs far as finding a job it\u2019s best to start with your network. that\u2019s usually the easiest way in. Hit up your friends, family, and even old coworker and people you went to school with. Ask if their company is hiring or if they know someone who is. A lot of jobs get filled through word of mouth before they even hit job boards. Also be flexible in what jobs you consider. Just about any job is better than no job when you\u2019re unemployed. It\u2019s key to remember that you\u2019re not above anything when it comes to jobs. Even if you take a job that sucks, use it to build your resume and earn income while you look for a better one.\n\nAnother key thing to remember is that your first few jobs are most likely not going to be your forever career. Unless you\u2019re a doctor, lawyer or something of that nature. Most people don\u2019t end up into a career path until much later in life. If your super focused on having a career right out of the gate your going to stress yourself out, even when you do find a job. \n\nAs far as dealing with the friends and family asking you about what your plans are (I know it can be annoying and frustrating to constantly hear), remember they are asking because they genuinely care about you and your future. it\u2019s not to piss you off or look down on you despite it  to seemingly have that effect. Back when I would hear that question I would turn it back to them and ask them if they had any recommendations or knew anyone hiring. \n\nBack when I graduated many years ago with a communications degree I thought I was going have a career in film production. After a two year stint teaching English abroad in Japan and then a 6 month stint living back at home with my parents unemployed I eventually did find a job in the social work field. Now many years and jobs later I have a found a career in banking.",

I wish I had been able to get a tour and meet other employees, but I wasn't. And if there is one think I *could* be particular on, it's just making sure the cultural fit is there.

It's a great fit with good pay, and I feel so incredibly lucky to have found it. \n\nI'm completely unfamiliar with office culture though, so I'm feeling a unsure about how to navigate taking a vacation this summer. I'm also in a bit of a unique situation, so I would really love some advice/help on what to do-\n\nFirst, I am technically in a temporary position. The job offer I signed said my position would \"end 6 months after the start date\". Because of this, I do not get any benefits, except a 401k. I say \"technically\" though because literally everyone around me, including my direct superior, says it will turn to permanent at that time. My boss even told me to start thinking about a project I'll need to have done in December.\n\nWhen I got this job, I started planning a 2 week vacation for the beginning of August, since I thought I would be done with the job at the end of July. \n\nLong story short, would it be appropriate for me to ask to take a two week unpaid vacation? If so, do I wait until after I'm offered a permanent position? Do I bring it up during that conversation? \n\nThis job is 1000x more important to me than the vacation. If it truly will be the permanent, I cannot lose it. For my current situation, it is a bit of a dream job. But if I'm able to both enjoy my summer with a vacation, and get to have a permanent job, I don't want to miss that opportunity either.\n\nThank you for your thoughts! \n\nSide note- not sure if relevent, but when I was offered the job, I asked for a week off in early March for my best friend's wedding. They agreed, so I have already taken 1 week of unpaid vacation.",

It is a good job and has great benefits with long term opportunities, but I tried my damn best to get the career I wanted.\n\n I was jobless for 3 months and I interviewed like 9 times before I got this job.

They keep telling me,\" We are looking to hire immediately\", but takes weeks and multiple rounds of interviews, only to be rejected(even for entry level job(. All 9 interviews, I always made it to the final round but never gotten the job or selected. It hurt me alot and I thought I was worthless.\n\nAnyway, I am I guess okay with where I am at right now. The company is great and job security sounds good, just sad I didn't really get what I truly wanted. Anyone experiencing this?",

Unemployment was keeping me afloat on the majority of my expenses and I\u2019ve been using my credit card to cover the rest. I worked very hard to get into my professional field but the reality is I need more than unemployment. My field relies on govt funding so who knows when I\u2019ll find a job in that field again due to current issues in the US right now.\n\nI just accepted an offer for a position back in blue collar work. It\u2019s honest work and respectable work. If I worked just 40 hrs a week at this new job that pays hourly I am making slightly less than my previous salary job where I worked more than 40 hours with no overtime pay. I was told in my interview that there are opportunities for paid overtime. I will likely make more at this new job because of the paid overtime. It\u2019s also much simpler work so I\u2019m anticipating my energy levels to increase since I won\u2019t be mentally exhausted from the dysfunctional and disorganized workflows of the previous company (that place was a serious shitshow).\n\nI\u2019m upset because I really did work my ass off to get into that professional field doing what I enjoyed and I feel like I\u2019m taking a few steps back until I remind myself that it\u2019s just a job. I plan to continue to look for a position in my preferred field and luckily will have my days free for any interviews. At the end of the day I\u2019m grateful I found employment with comparable pay.",

        "content": "Am I being exploited? What would you do about my situation.\nI am quite young, just turned 21, because of health reasons I had to leave university and in the meanwhile I decided to apply for a job in a local thriving retailer/ gas station. This is my second job only so I don\u2019t really have much experience and it is quite hard for me to adjust to life with so little free time.\n\nAt first, I really liked it there, despite some meaner colleagues who expect me to be on par with the branch manager on my second day of work, it was very nice. Our boss seemed very nice, she kept constantly giving me compliments about my work performance, my ethics etc. She would tell me constantly that I have nothing to worry about and that they don\u2019t expect anything from me yet and that I should just try my best and it would be ok. I have to work with a mentor for my first month. She is the person I have every shift with and the person supposed to teach me. On my 7th day of work my mentor asked our boss if she could change her evening shift to morning because she had been invited to a formal party. She got our boss\u2019s approval, but now my boss asked me to take the shift with her. That means that my 8 hours shift ended at 11:00 PM and I had to be back at work for 5:45 AM. It takes me around an hour to get home, hour to get to bed. I have to get up around 4:40 AM which gave me roughly 3-4 hours of sleep. The worst part is that I found this the day I had my evening shift. I was told I had a choice, but in reality that was an illusion, because my other choice was to work an evening shift alone with another trainee. To make things worse MY MENTOR DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO LET ME OPEN BY MYSELF. My boss poured me in compliments again saying that I was \u201calready ready\u201d \u201clearning fast\u201d and so on. By then I started having suspicions. So I was given A KEY on my 7th day of work and after my 3 hours of sleep I had to come to work ALONE as A TRAINEE and open the store by myself. There isn\u2019t that much to do, but a lot to potentially f*ck up. I ended up doing great, I had forgotten to put one singular sausage on the grill. \n\nMy boss told me and I remember vividly her telling me that she will try to not change my schedule this month anymore. A week passes and I am on my morning shift. Everything is going great, 6 hours have passed and I only have 2-3 left. I have done A LOT of work. My boss had came in at 8 already and we greeted and exchanged a few words. As I am working she comes up to me and asks in a worried voice \u201cdid I not ask you to come to the evening shift today?\u201d. I replied \u201cno, I don\u2019t remember so\u201d. She kept insisting that she remembers asking me. I am REALLY SURE she didn\u2019t. As it turns out somebody is sick. The girl I was supposed to work the evening shift is not attending work and I had been put in her place\u2026but without me knowing. I understand that I am supposed to follow the changes made in the schedule, but we DONT have a digital schedule anywhere available as far as I know and the few pages that were printed out when the changes were made were taken in a matter of minutes. I did not bother taking any as the only change that I was told I have BY MY BOSS was the story I told before. She said that no other changes have been made. I tell her that I have already worked almost an entire shift today. Her solution was to let me go home FOR AROUND 5 HOURS OR LESS and then come back to work for my evening shift. That meant that I had spent around 6 hours at work, had around 3 hours of free time realistically including travelling back and forth and then another 6 hours at work. I had been awake for around 19 hours of which I spent 12 at work. By the I started feeling as all those compliments given to me were just empty to make me feel more important etc. I know there are a lot of harder jobs out there with crazier shifts and in comparison mine is ok, but for me this all just seems a little bit too much. I would be fine if the job wasn\u2019t so draining, the flow of people is crazy, we get a lot of customers and according to my contract and from personal experience as well, working behind the register is genuinely one of the smaller responsibilities. There is so much to do and keep track of, so much to learn. My shifts are so inconsistent throughout the week that it is really hard to manage any free time, house chores, other responsibilities. ",

After being fired 1.5 years ago from a very toxic team and management, I got into another one that has a nice team, but toxic management. I know the answer to this question is a \"no\", but how can someone stay sane while working?\n\nAm trying to do my best just to be given written warnings for my performance, despite telling them that I always strive my best though the internal evaluations are average. I have pointed out that my CSATs (customer reviews) have always been positive and always make sure they are left satisfied to the point I give them my working hours and days. I have brought these concerns my supervisor and manager and they said the reviews are \"biased\". I got very upset at the time and pointed out how someone in supervisor and manager role can say that these reviews are \"biased\" and how they are telling me that customer's voice don't matter.\n\nI am in the process of looking for another job, but it seems difficult since I do have seven years of IT customer support and I think am considered \"overqualified\" despite not seeking certifications or degrees, but have a lot of working knowledge on various systems and applications. I did not want to pursue a degree or a certification because companies these days don't hire unless you are from a university or have the experience. I bring up the university because an intern with my same degree got into a NOC role and when I applied I was not given the opportunity because of my role despite knowing how everything does work.\n\nI keep applying different jobs, hoping for a better future, but I feel like these job seeking websites are filled with previous positions that were filed or as a HR rep told me once: \"they forget to remove them\".\n\nLooking forward to your responses! Thank you!",

                "content": "\"Should\" is a loaded word.\n\nBut an employee whose performance seems not to be satisfying their manager's expectations would be wise to expect that they will lose their job if performance does not improve.\n\nYou should ask your leadership for specifics about where your performance is not meeting expectations. It may be that you are meeting expectations, which in a well-managed organization is actually average.\n\nCompanies expect customer reviews to be good--that means the employee did their job. When the response is less than good, that is a sign that something (process, product, or people) is not working well.\n\nI've seen plenty of underperforming employees who were friendly to customers and received according high marks but whose performance--not always visible to the customer--was subpar.\n\nFor instance, in college (35 years ago) I briefly had a job as a motor bank teller.\n\nI sucked at the most important at part of the job--collecting and returning the right amount of cash. I was consistently off by anywhere from a few pennies to several dollars. But I was a super friendly, outgoing teller and customers liked me.\n\nWe were expected to balance to the penny daily. (I understand that banks are a bit more forgiving today.)\n\nI knew my job was on the line and I tried very hard but I'm ADD (undiagnosed at that time), easily distracted, and have a poor attention to detail.\n\nSo, one day, I arrived at work and my boss--a lovely woman name Deidra--called me in her office. I knew I hadn't balanced the previous day and assumed this was \"it\" for me.\n\nD: \"Mike, you didn't balance again yesterday.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, I know. I hope you know that I'm really trying but I understand that I need to be more careful.\"\n\nD: \"Do you remember Mrs. So-and-so coming through your line?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, she's a regular. Always picks my lane. Big black Cadillac.\"\n\nD: \"Right. She's the bank president's wife.\" \n\nMe: thinking \"well, shit. I screwed up her transaction.\"\n\nD: \"She called her husband after she came through your line yesterday...\"\n\nMe: thinking \"here it comes.\"\n\nD: \"and told him how friendly and welcoming you are. He sent down this memo for you.\" And she hands me a very nice memo from the president of the bank, whose name I'd never known until that moment.\n\nMe: \"Wow. That's cool! She's very kind.\"\n\nD: stares at me with a smile of resignation mixed with amusement\n\nMe: \"So I'm not getting fired for not balancing?\"\n\nD: \"Not today.\"\n\nMe: \"But I should realize that I'm probably not cut out for being a bank teller and go find something else to help pay for school.\"\n\nD: \"I think that would be a good decision.\"\n\nI'd already seen the writing on the wall and had put feelers out. And I landed an internship in a role much more appropriate for my skillset and deficits.\n\nThat turned into a full-time role and set me on the career path that led me to where I am today.",

        "content": "Burnt out, and confused?\nI don't really know what to title this, it's probably just a rant. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I have tried my absolute best at the job I'm at currently and it's just wearing me down. I love my team and I love my customers, and the amazing thing is that they love me back just as much. \n\nI just cannot take another day working for the owner. She is manipulative, gossips about ALL of her employees to other employees and customers, and doesn't follow through with her word. \n\nFebruary 10th her and her husband pulled me into the break room and told me they were seriously looking for a regional manager to manage their three stores. They told me they would like to offer the position internally before looking outward, and that I was the best fit possible. (I have over 16 years experience in the industry, corporate experience, and an amazing record for change and improvement in my previous management position.) \n\nThey told me the position would involve a lot of driving and that I'd have to work at all three locations each week. They are within 20 miles of each other so that is no problem at all for me. I do commute about 50 miles but I had planned on moving closer anyhow and I saw this as an opportunity to be able to afford to do so. \n\nI immediately accepted the offer and they said they wanted to give me a day or two to think it over and discuss it with my husband, because it would involve me being gone more. \n\nI went home and discussed it with my husband and he was overjoyed and excited for me and told me to accept if that was what I wanted and that he would absolutely support me in this if it's what I wanted. So the next day I attempted to accept the position formally. The owner blew me off completely and said she would talk to me about it later, and that she had discussed it with her husband and that they decided to make it a team effort, and she would update me soon. \n\nTwo days later I had told them I needed to talk to an employee about her performance, she had already received two prior warnings and was on a plan for improvement, and she had not completed the majority of her tasks the night forward. I let the owner know that this would be the employee's final warning (we are required to report every warning to the owner prior to giving one). The owner had told me that since the complaint involved multiple employees that it would need to be in a group setting, and that I needed to have each employee that had complained express to her how her poor performance had affected them. I instantly had a horrible feeling that essentially calling her out and making her look incompetent in front of her peers was not the right way to handle it. I expressed this to the owner but she said, this was the only way she would understand and improve, I disagreed, but said I would handle it the way she had wanted. \n\nTen minutes before that meeting took place the owners husband called and let me know they decided to hire someone else for the Regional manager position.\n\nI handled the situation exactly as directed despite my feeling that it was not appropriate.\n\nThe employee was upset and quit right after the meeting. She called her parents who then called the owners and began threatening them and me with a lawsuit. She was not a minor so the owners said they wouldn't discuss it with the parents and that they supported my decision.  \n\nA few days after the situation the owners husband came in and I expressed that I was completely blindsided and upset at how everything transpired with the position being offered and then being told that it was given to someone else. With absolutely ZERO, experience in our industry. I told the that I felt that the whole situation was handled very unprofessionally, and that I was considering leaving because of how they had handled everything.\n\nHe told me he would relay the message to his wife and they would try to fix things. But that they had been disappointed with how I had handled the employee situation and that had affected their decision. This absolutely made no sense because I had followed company policy of two warnings, PIP, then final warning. And I hadn't even had the meeting with her before they told me they offered the position to someone else. \n\nThe owner text messaged me. Her brain was all over the place that day and that they didn't actually mean to offer me the position, that they felt that if I had taken the position that it would be too much driving for me and they were scared to lose me because I am invaluable and irreplaceable, so they felt that it was best to give the position to someone else so that they didn't lose me. \n\nI talked with the new person they hired for the position and they told him a completely different story. Inf fact in his words, \"I have heard about it non-stop.\" I asked him what had been said. They said that my store was a disaster and that I couldn't manage my store properly, so how could I manage all three locations! That they never actually offered me the position and tried to make it seem like I was crazy basically. \n\nShe has NEVER once criticized me or my store, or my performance. It has been absolutely nothing but praise, and speaking highly of me to and in front of me, my customers, and my staff. She has always been thankful for all my hard work and dedication, driving over 50 miles through rain, snow and ice, and never being late. Setting a great example for my store and employees, and implementing amazing policies to improve our store. She even gave me a large bonus to say thank you. (The above praises are her words not mine.) \n\nIt makes zero sense why she would say these things to him. \n\nAgain, I love my team, I love what I do, and I love my customers and the relationships I have built. But I absolutely cannot work for a person who lies, and manipulates like this. I want to quit but my team is going to be devastated and so will my customers, so will I. I just feel trapped, and confused, and very hurt. ",

        "content": "Here\u2019s How to Break Into Investment Banking\nNetworking into investment banking is a game, it\u2019s sales. The systems I\u2019m about to share worked for me, but I highly recommend learning these skills naturally and being genuine, rather than just using a template. Otherwise, you\u2019ll come across as having an agenda, and no one appreciates that. \n\nOkay let\u2019s get into it. First off, start a spreadsheet (bc banking) that helps you track the people you talk with. This is mainly for reminding yourself to follow up every few months. Doesn\u2019t have to be complicated, just the persons name, firm, title, some notes, and the date you last talked to them. \n\nThe two methods I used were LinkedIn and email (shocker). I could write an entire post on each of these but, for brevity, I\u2019ll stick to the important stuff. \n\nTo initiate a conversation, always have an icebreaker. Some examples: you went to the same school, you just read an interesting article they were featured in, they\u2019re your rich uncle, or maybe you just enjoyed one of their LinkedIn posts.\n\nTo set up a coffee chat (quick Zoom or phone call), shoot them an email or message that is only a couple of sentences and asks for 15-30min of their time. Do NOT be overly formal. \n\nTrust me, as someone who\u2019s now on the receiving end of these messages, if someone is being formal it feels like they have an agenda or think it\u2019s an interview. But I get it, I used to wear a suit and tie for these calls and now I realize how silly I must\u2019ve looked. \n\nI\u2019ll pause there and do a part 2 if needed.",

From what I can see:\n\n1. The formatting is pretty bad. I'm using some old template and the spacing between the lines is somehow both claustrophobic as well as leaving too much open space in other areas. If someone could suggest a new template to use that would be amazing.\n\n2. It's not all relevant FP&A experience. I know I might not seem like the most serious candidate and some of my bullet points might be too general. Like, I know I have some student run equity fund as experience but I've only had one position after graduating so that one is the most relevant by far so I'm really just putting the other experience because I need stuff to put on my resume.\n\n3. My latest position wasn't specifically FP&A. It was financial reporting on the reporting and analysis team and I was looking for advice on how to tailor my experiences to target FP&A roles exclusively. What skills/experience should I try to highlight more or less? What should I reword/change to appeal to hiring managers in FP&A?\n\n4. If it's not my resume and just my experience what skills/experiences should I prioritize so that I can learn them and set myself up to be a stronger candidate for FP&A roles?\n\n5. Is the wording too verbose? I ran it through Chatgpt to help put more keywords and just make it sound better while trying not to make it sound too fluffed up like im saying a whole bunch of nothing. If I were to write it all myself I feel like I'd word it worse and couldn't come up with a way of describing things that sounds professional and eloquent.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\n",

I\u2019m currently living in London and want to get an idea of what other paths/industries I should consider\n\nMy background is:\n\n- traditional 3 years of audit at one of the big 4, gained my ACA qualification\n\n- A year or so at the same big 4 firm working in Risk Assurance/Consulting\n\n- 2 years working in a commercial team at a large Telecomms company, essentially explaining in quarter trading performance/variance analysis. Doing no modelling and some insight/analysis work\n\n- 2.5 years at a mid size Tech company working in Finance and Strategy. This has been a blend of Commercial Finance, FP&A and Strategy work. I was promoted about 6 months ago and have my first direct report starting in a couple of months. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this role, as I get to do intricate modelling, and present insights/make suggestions to senior leadership. However when I see what my boss does it seems to be just aligning with other teams/dealing with politics for not much more money\n\nI think the ideal role for me would have the following:\n\n- I really enjoy building models/forward looking/ strategic work\n\n- Less reporting/reconciling reports. This is the element of the job I enjoy the least\n\n- Higher salary/salary potential. Currently I\u2019m making \u00a380k with a 10% bonus. I hear of various roles/industries where \u00a3100k+ is the norm, and bonuses are much more than 10%\n\n- Possible something where I get to work with clients. I enjoy developing a relationship with people and think I could be good at selling\n\nIf you were in my position what roles/industries would you look into? Any advice on first steps to making the change?\n\n",

Very stable, pay is 200k ish in MCOL but get bored with it and my boss is not someone you would want to work with in the long run. 4.5 YOE so far with different BBs and 1.5 years with the current employer. Kind of wondering is it a good time to switch job now? Want to get back to asset management (cleared CFA level 1&2 and CAIA, has some AM experience before) or go to fintech (has CS background as well) if possible. Can someone shed some light on those areas?",

And if you are taking a pay cut, imagine how much it will string to feel like you're discounting your pay, having to adjust to a new job, and having new pain points, *just* to switch things up.

Then my career path went quite wobly/weird. I think i was too insecure to think i could be an investment analyst, i thought it was mainly for alpha males- i am an introverted sensitive woman. Worked as a project manager, then turnen into the health sector for a few years. Now i did a bootcamp in data analytics. I loved it! Finally something that cracks my brain again. I liked financial analyses  the most but i am not yet enough equiped i think to become an investment analyst. What are possible next steps to take?",

        "content": "At what point in your career can you be more vocal/direct in bonus discussions, vs just saying thank you so much?\nI'm at a commodity trade shop. It's a pod set up, in the sense that I get paid directly out of the boss' pocket (% of book structure). I'm not exactly a trader, more so an analyst/trader, do everything kind of person. I know I'm very valuable and good at my job, but it's not necessarily super transferable. I did switch companies once.\n\nI'm well paid ($just got bumped from $110K to $140K base, and have a good life). I'm way farther along, and making a lot more money than my coworkers my age. And my newest 'role' will be really good in terms of skills and resume.\n\nI am strongly anticipating that my bonus will be the same or a little bit down from last year (40K). I've never once complained, or even had to argue in 7 years of my career. I know I'm very privileged. Especially with the economic and industry wide out look being challenged right now. Also, I've already decided I want to pivot jobs within a year or two anyways.\n\nIn general though, I know I'm going to end up feeling mad about it:\n\n* My bosses constantly brag about how amazing this company is, while other places in the industry have better pay packages for junior people in general. My bonuses haven't really grown in like 4 years. Perhaps I've just reached a bit of a ceiling based on my age and not being in a strictly risk-taking role.\n* Boss has borderline lied / led me on about bonuses before. In general, just promising the world because they have totally unrealistic growth expectations for our book\n* I have kinda figured out how the entire pay system works, and in general, I'm convinced the one boss especially gets a very sweetheart deal. In general, I think some of the senior people here get super overpaid. \n* Senior people have a WAY more formulaic pay system. I end up doing a bunch of stuff outside my job title, and feel it doesn't necessarily get rewarded properly come bonus time, because that money is already spoken for in the senior people's payouts. However, I guess this is maybe why I can get the higher base salary than most.\n* My bosses said I would get direct payouts for stuff I bring in. Let's say I did a physical trade, fully on my own, that netted like $15K for the bonus pot. There's not always transparency on where this goes, and I feel like they make it seem like a black box. If anything, this disincentivizes hard work because I feel like I'm making my boss money without seeing a piece of the pie.\n\nSo in this situation; I have a fairly good set up overall, but feel I am not quite getting a fair deal.\n\nIs it worth trying to have a professional discussion where I tell them why I deserve more?\n\nOr should I just say thank you and silently figure out how to move forward (get a different job), etc. I also fear that if I argue, I might get an extra $5K or something and then also harm my reputation\n\nI think my bosses think I'm really young and naive...however they are also the type to get very sensitive if anybody criticizes anything.",

But generally speaking you can be more direct when you can point to revenue that you are directly responsible for. Be direct with your boss and ask for specific actionables that will increase your pay. specific is the keyword here \n\nWhat I would suggest for you is to hone your work focus more to your goal of a bonus. If you're the most junior person, then its hard to say no, but you basically need to stop doing things you know won't get you paid, that in turn will free you up to do things that should contribute to your bonus.",

Important to note that you yourself will be on the \u201csell side\u201d as a service provider (as opposed to the \u201cbuy side\u201d which are the companies conducting capital deployment), and that as a \u201csell side\u201d professional you can be in divestment deals (sell side advisory) as well as acquisition deals (buy side advisory).\n\nAssuming the latter, it sounds like the role would be closer to a vendor DD role. You are still a service provider, but your role is to do a deep dive on 1. the commercials (ie., evaluating whether the assumptions that feed into the valuation model are reasonable and backed by facts), 2. the financials (this could be from a tax/accounting perspective, or you could be part of the team that builds the models for the different growth scenarios), or 3. the legal matters (though this is always a law firm that is typically also the engaged LA for the transaction).\n\nYou should double check what the role actually entails \u2014 and rather than asking reddit to give you ideas for an interview, suggest you do your own analysis + brainstorming and then ask for feedback.",

I\u2019ve been working in Transaction Advisory Services at a boutique firm in the Southeast since June after graduating in May. So far, I\u2019ve been performing well with strong utilization, solid feedback, and good exposure.\n\nRecently, I received an offer for an Investment Banking Analyst role at a small middle-market boutique with about 10-15 people. IB was my original post-grad goal, so I\u2019m naturally interested, but I\u2019m having second thoughts. The firm is quite small and only closes a handful of deals per year, which makes me worried about being pigeonholed and limiting my exit opportunities. I also really enjoy working with my current team, and leaving after less than a year is something I\u2019m struggling with.\n\nIn addition, I\u2019m thinking about pursuing an MBA down the road, so I\u2019m weighing how this move would impact my long-term goals. I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who has made this transition before, or if you have thoughts on how this would align with a potential future MBA and a career path targeting PE or CorpDev.",

Also good job on getting a 4.0 first term, but remember that this is college, not HS, and people don\u2019t care about 4.0s. A 4.0 in college is not sustainable, doesn\u2019t differentiate you, and actively sets you back by taking away time that would\u2019ve been better spent on professional development. The people who leave college with the best jobs aren\u2019t the 4.0 kids\u2014 they are the 3.8 kids who saw diminishing returns on studies and dedicated the extra free time to recruiting, networking, and getting smart on the job market.\n\nIn any event, you are not cooked.

        "content": "Post-Grad Paths\nHello,\n\nI am currently in a sticky situation and am looking for some career advice. Currently, I am expected to graduate with a bachelor's degree in finance in May from a non-target school. I am expecting a cumulative GPA of 3.0 and major GPA of 3.3. I have obtained my SIE but have no prior internship experience. The reason I am posting today is because I recently slipped up within my college town and now will be doing about a year and a half of probation. This combined with my relatively lackluster qualifications leave me uncertain on how to advance in my career post-graduation. Due to the strictness of FINRA, I don't believe I can obtain any Series licenses (besides 65), so that rules out a lot of paths for the next 18 months. \n\nAfter spending a lot of time researching different alternatives, I have started to consider a few options. I have thought about pursuing the CFA level 1, while enrolling in an MSc Finance program to further my education and reclass me in the recruitment cycle for internships. I have also considered taking the upcoming year and a half off to chip away at the CFA and Wall Street Prep Courses, while also aggressively networking. Lastly, I have considered the idea of going for an MSc (or other masters) in a different subject in order to diversify myself, given the fact that I already have a background in finance.  \n\nDo these sound like viable options to boost my career given my current situation? If so, which would be recommended? If not, what are some other options? I find the idea of continuing education most attractive but don't want to put myself in 25k of debt if it has no real benefit. I am extremely passionate in the subject and willing to put in the hours in order to get over this bump in the road. \n\nThank you for your time and advice.",

I mainly wanted to get feedback on if it worthwhile, assuming I get accepted into a good program. \n\nWould you recommend pursuing the CFA simultaneously with an MSc program? I've been considering it due to a light courseload to end my school year over the next 3 months, as well as already having taken related coursework (ex. derivatives, quantitative methods, financial statement analysis, fixed income, etc.).

You need to network and get an internship. \n\nYou might think you know the material in the courses because of your undergrad classes but I guarantee you do not. If you do, either you went to a fantastic undergrad or you\u2019re going to a shit grad school. Furthermore, why are you taking courses you already know? Use your time and your money more wisely. \n\nEven if you get the CFA while in school, no employers will care too much as you\u2019re presumably going to graduate with a masters as well. As I said, a CFA is only useful in conjunction with work experience. It also is not a main reason people get hired. It is a tiebreaker reason. \n\nYour time is better spent doing other things if you plan to go back to school. I\u2019m not going to give you suggestions as to what to do; you need to figure that out. \n\nYour issue will be that no one will want to hire you without experience.

What are the prerequisites requirements to enter the CFA? What careers is it useful for? Does fp&a/corp finance meet their work experience requirements?\n\n\n\n1.) I see that you only need an undergraduate bachelor's degree. Is that really it? No requirement for the degree, the course content, grades GPA, etc? \n\n--------\n\n2.) And what careers is this useful for? I ideally would like to become CFO and CEO one day. I am not necessarily locked into a specific industry, but in terms of careers I am in corp finance/fp&a/management accounting.\n\n-----------\n\n3.) Further, would my work experience even qualify for the work experience requirements? It'd be unfortunate if I finish all the academic requirements only to not get the CFA due to my career.\n\n----------\n\n4.) All you need is to successfully complete three exams and gain 36 months of work experience, and 2 (or 3, if you want) professional references. Is that correct? Is any of this difficult to get? Not talking about the difficulty of the exams, but rather the difficulty of the admin related work relating to all these. \n\n-----------\n\n5.) Is there a time limit to any of this? Like if you graduated with bachelor's in a certain year, or began the CFA in a certain year? Is there a limited number of attempts if you fail the exams? Do you have unlimited attempts until you pass?",

Recruitment hasn't gone my way this year, and it's been tough securing interviews. My career aspiration is to work in investment banking. I can attach my CV for you to review. Currently, I'm \"working\" part time at a two-man boutique firm ran by an ex-Goldman employee. Deals are slow-moving, and I don't get paid, but I do get to work on some aspects of the process (presentations/paper work).\u00a0\n\nI'm questioning the current issues/worries preventing me from applying to a master's program right away: \u00a0\n\n1. My grades are poor right now. I currently have a 2.2 but hope to graduate with a low to mid 2.1. So I don't have much faith in getting into Oxford/LBS with my grades right now.\n\n2. The market is currently awful, and it's more competitive than ever. I heard most of the top master programs took a hit to IB recruitment.\u00a0\n\n3. I'm currently considering applying for a deferred MBA and appreciate more time to study for the GRE (I believe master's students can apply for a deferred MBA). \u00a0\n\nIf I were to take a year out, it would take the pressure off and allow me to focus on my university work and apply for off-cycles. Regarding any \"gap\" on my CV, I could fill it in by stating that I was working at this boutique firm for most of the time.\u00a0\n\nWith a year on my hand I can study my GRE, prep for technicals, and hopefully end up at a top master program during a decent market environment for IB recruitment.\u00a0\n\nI think this would give me the best chance at succeeding as it'll allow me to hit the ground running and be more prepared.\u00a0",

        "content": "Would I Be Shooting Myself in the Foot Joining the Army?\nSo I have about 2 months until I finish University (UK), I\u2019m on track to get a 2:1 in Economics and Finance. My mid term goal is to break into investment banking as soon as possible (and then exit into something a bit more relaxed after 3-5 years), however with no internships and a non-target uni, I won\u2019t be able to do that immediately. So I plan to get some work experience, and then try to get into a top MBA (goal London Business School). From there I\u2019d obviously be hoping to jump in at associate level.\n\nThe problem is the years before my MBA. Most look for ~5 years of work experience, and at the moment I have a year and a half at a HSBC call centre and about 3 months as a financial admin (other than McDonalds type roles). I\u2019ve been looking at an Intelligence Officer role, which has a 3.5 year term. I\u2019ve heard that MBA programs like the military leadership experience, however this would be at the expense of any finance related experience. I would be leading intelligence analysts in this role, however again nothing finance related.\n\nI understand banks like JPM have veteran schemes, however how well would an MBA and Army experience serve me with no prior internships and no working analyst experience? Am I best off getting a year or two of analyst experience before the army? Would I even be able to get into an MBA program without this experience? \n\nAny advice greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n",

Much of finance is intertwined with accounting and they are really two sides of the same coin. You can\u2019t really go wrong with this one especially if you\u2019re interested in IB, PE, Venture Capital, or anything that requires knowledge of a business\u2019s financials.\n\n- Business Administration: pretty self explanatory, you\u2019ll get a general business education which could he useful but it is pretty broad.\n\n- Business Analytics: could be useful if you\u2019re interested in data and the more tech side of finance. Business Analytics majors varying widely so I can\u2019t really give a solid answer about this one other than it could be useful if you are interested in data/programming/stats\n\n- Business Economics: pretty vague but it\u2019s definitely going to be a more theory focused major. If that\u2019s for you, great. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to add very little to you professional skills wise \n\n- Business Management: not really sure what the difference between this and Administration is.\n\n- Entrepreneurship: I would avoid this UNLESS you are interested in specifically venture capital or working for a startup. It\u2019s not a bad major, but it\u2019s probably less helpful than a lot of the others.\n\n- MIS: not really sure what the difference between this and Business Analytics is. Probably tech heavy as well but maybe with a bit more focus on the programming and less on the data. Maybe pursue this if you\u2019re interested in FinTech. \n\n- Marketing: doesn\u2019t add too much to your finance degree. Would avoid\n\n- Supply Chain: niche and not super related. Avoid unless you\u2019re interested in specifically international trade.",

As someone who has always prioritized academics and worked really hard to get into my target business school , I didn\u2019t maximize it.

I\u2019m not too worried about recruiting, it\u2019s more about the graduates programs I want to get in later on. \nIt\u2019s so weird I can\u2019t even enjoy a happy moment because I remind myself that nonetheless I\u2019m a failure and couldn\u2019t do what most people achieve. It\u2019s even affecting my dating life , my gf is becoming a doctor and I feel like I don\u2019t deserve her and she deserves someone smarter, I know it sounds weird but I think I\u2019d never amount to much. \nI know I can\u2019t change the past and have to work 10x harder which I\u2019m totally willing to do but I also know low gpa  will always haunt me. I don\u2019t feel confident with interviewing either because the employer deserve someone with a higher gpa. \n\nI wanted to ask to experienced people on how to coupe with this , im even considering going to therapy for this. I\u2019m not in depression anymore but this thing is holding me very severely to just enjoy my days. I look at my parents and feel bad that the kid they love so much couldn\u2019t make them proud , although they say they are very proud of me. ",

Which is ridiculous because if you believe that after 2.5 years, is when I am going to have the opportunity to really grow here, then you have been doing it wrong as an employer and managers and aren't aligned with me and my perception of my career growth and trajectory. \n\n\nAnd it's also maybe not easy to just say \"growth opportunity\" because over here, they do try a lot to give growth opportunities to us. \n\nBut the thing is I want to leave because:\n - bad wlb\n\n - a lot of useless tasks, unnecessary arbitrary stress due to said useless tasks\n\n- over it. Interested in moving on to another industry, role, work, to see something different\n\n- (potentially) higher salary\n\nSo what can I say to them? I need my responses to their questions and counterpoints to be effective and also not make me seem like I am going \"just for a change\" to a worse off role. The perception should be that I am making a move upwards.",

        "content": "Seeking Advice: Transitioning from CA to M&A Law Practice India\nMy Background:\n- Chartered Accountancy (CA) Student: Currently preparing for my CA Final examination scheduled for this November.\n\nProfessional Experience:\n\t\u2022\tCompleted 1.5 years of articleship training in Audit.\n\t\u2022\tSpent another 1.5 years as a trainee in a strategy role at a leading multinational corporation, which offered me a broader perspective beyond traditional accounting.\n\nPersonal Context:\n\nI come from a well-established family in Mumbai, where financial constraints have thankfully not been a significant concern. This privilege allows me to take more risk and chase some sort of entrepreneurship (a practice or potentially a start up) rather than a salary package.\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nWhile the traditional CA roles, such as Audit and Taxation, provide stability, I\u2019ve found them to be less engaging and highly saturated. \n\nWorking on the corporate side of things in fields like strategy/marketing/ corporate finance is interesting but again, I think the salary post CA just does not feel like it\u2019s enough for me.\n\nRecognising the saturation in these fields, I\u2019m contemplating a pivot towards Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Law. This interest stems from a desire to blend my financial expertise with legal acumen, aiming to carve out a niche that is both intellectually stimulating and professionally rewarding.\n\nGuidance Received:\n\nMentors, particularly seasoned lawyers excelling in the M&A domain, have suggested the following pathway:\n1.\tPursue an LLB in India: Post-CA, enroll in a three-year law program to build a solid legal foundation.\n2.\tSpecialize Internationally: After obtaining the LLB, pursue specialized certifications or advanced degrees in International M&A Law from reputable European institutions.\n3. Eventually start my own practice in this field, where I can work internationally and leverage the increasing deal activity globally. (And be somewhat an entrepreneur)\n\nSeeking Insights On:\n\nTime Investment: Having dedicated several years to the CA qualification, I\u2019m concerned about the additional time required to obtain an LLB and further specializations. Would this extended educational journey be a prudent investment?\n\nSynergy of Qualifications: Does combining a CA with an LLB provide a significant advantage in establishing a niche M&A practice? How have professionals with dual qualifications fared in the industry?\n\nAlternative Pathways: Are there other specialized fields within finance or law that might align with my entrepreneurial goals without necessitating a complete career pivot? Or should I try to get an MBA from a top college, work in an exciting and demanding start-up (more paying than CA) and eventually try to set up a business of my own.\n\nI would greatly appreciate insights from those who have navigated similar transitions or possess experience at the intersection of finance and law. Your guidance will be instrumental in shaping my career trajectory.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time for me!",

And the better you do the harder the questions they ratchet to you. If you do not know the topic or subject matter -- just say you don't know the matter enough to opine. They usually get their satisfaction if you do that. Say the wrong answer... well consider yourself toast or in tears. I got asked a really stupid question on CDS duration and convexity on long end of the curve. I basically looked at the managing director and said \"Look I don't know much about cds but if it behaves like a traditional bond than longer duration should have more convexity associated, but again I'm not a subject matter expert at all and it is something I want to learn\". That for me sealed my credit trading seat.",

I have been with the same bank ever since. I started out as a commercial loan processor/ customer service rep. I held that position for about 6 months and then was promoted to a commercial lending roll. Over the course of my 4ish years lending, I have gotten a good grasp on the lending process and have learned how to do many types of loan under Commercial, Consumer, and SBA applications. To give an idea of my production, I did $33.4 Million in loans for 2024. Granted, a lot of that came from already established customers but I still worked my ass off. Beginning of this year, I was promoted to assistant vice president.\n\nWhat I am struggling with now is my pay. I\u2019m salary at $76,000 not including my bonus. Highest bonus I\u2019ve seen was 10k. When I started in 2020, I was making $50,000. In my opinion, I feel like I should be making more money but maybe I\u2019m wrong? My wife works full time but will soon have to lighten her work load as we have a 2 year old and another on the way. I need to make more money to supplement her income loss. \n\nFor those who have been in banking, how do you know if you\u2019re being paid fairly and how do you negotiate pay without being unreasonable and ruining your relationship with your boss? I really enjoy my job and the people I work with. I have had some really good mentors here and they have taught me a lot. I would love to continue working here but if I\u2019m not being paid enough, I would need to do what\u2019s best for my family and move on. \n\nCan someone shed some light? Appreciate everyone\u2019s time.",

        "content": "What is the best pathway I could take considering I have just inherited a few million?\nI am a going into first year of a semi target in the UK to do economics.\nDue to inheritance, I have found myself with circa \u00a33m from an inheritance post-tax.\n\nMy direct family is solidly middle class so I\u2019ve never seen this amount of wealth.\n\nI am reasonably stress tolerant and I believe that income won\u2019t really be a priority in the near future, just getting as much experience as I can until I can break into a sector where I could use this windfall to potentially progress my career, start a company or try to help develop another company involving taking an equity stake.\n\nI understand that this amount of cash is a drop in the bucket in most areas of banking so I was wondering if there are any areas within finance I could actually make a dent with this amount or by using this amount to raise more capital?\n\nI have some basic experience doing equity research specifically in healthcare equities at a small investment bank. I understand WACC, CAGR, how to model revenues from drugs, market share, regulation like ODD. I am no expert but I genuinely love doing research.\n\nWhat would your advice be to me in terms of attending insight events, gaining more experience this coming summer and my general pathway.\n\nJust to note, I know that social skills are of importance and worth improving but I struggle because of autism(actually diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s).\nI probably won\u2019t be anything special in anything very client-focussed.\n\n\n\nEDIT: \nI originally applied for mechanical engineering but decided to reapply for economics at the same university. I\u2019ve always loved engineering and tech, but after gaining some experience at an engineering firm, I realized I just didn\u2019t enjoy the work. I also recognize that I\u2019m probably not smart enough to be a truly great engineer. And even if I were, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to spend decades working on a highly specialized problem\u2014like designing a single component of an aircraft\u2014without much influence on the bigger picture.\n\n\n\nEDIT 2:\nWhy I Want to Go into Finance (Even Though Money Isn\u2019t My Main Motivation)\n\nI know most people go into finance because they want to make a lot of money, but for me, it\u2019s different. I\u2019m not driven by wealth for its own sake\u2014I see finance as a tool, a way to be involved in industries that actually excite me, especially engineering, technology, and biotech.\n\nI originally planned to study mechanical engineering, but after gaining experience at an aerospace firm, I realized I didn\u2019t enjoy the work itself. It felt too specialized, too focused on tiny components of a bigger system, with little control over the broader vision. And to be honest, I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019m not quite smart enough to be an exceptional engineer. That realization was tough, but it also made me rethink how I could engage with engineering in a way that actually suits me.\n\nAt the same time, I had an opportunity to analyze biotech firms, and I genuinely loved it. It wasn\u2019t just about looking at financials\u2014I enjoyed understanding the science, regulatory pathways, and what actually made these companies valuable beyond just their market cap. That experience made me realize that finance isn\u2019t just about moving money around; it\u2019s about backing the right ideas, allocating capital efficiently, and enabling industries that can change the world.\n\nThat\u2019s why I want to work at the intersection of finance, tech, and innovation. I don\u2019t just want to sit on my inheritance and play it safe\u2014I want to use it to gain experience, take calculated risks, and be involved in something bigger than myself. I know \u00a33 million isn\u2019t an endless amount, and I fully accept that I could lose it all. But I\u2019d rather take that risk than never try at all.\n\nAnd if it ever became clear that the best way forward was to donate it all to charity, I\u2019d be happy to do that too. My goal isn\u2019t just to accumulate wealth\u2014it\u2019s to do something meaningful with the resources I have.\n\n",

Then find jobs you are interested in, now you have two income streams.\n\nAt a market average return, you are easily earning well over \u00a3100,000 per year just in passive income.\n\nAdd a job in finance to that, and you can just consistently add to that pile. As you know compound growth is amplified the most by the earliest deposits, so run up the portfolio with your job income for a few years and just chill.\n\nI would also not recommend buying real estate, rent an apartment that's reasonable in price, and just enjoy your studies and any job you like my man.\n\nAnd for the love of God, please go talk to a reputable accountant at a major-midsize firm, and get a financial advisor that is licensed and can manage at least some of the investments for you, as an econ student you will be tempted to take risks with this money, when you should be focused on capital preservation and long term growth.",

        "content": "Remote work after graduation\nHello everyone. Long story short I'm plan on finishing a finance degree from WGU next year and im in a pretty unique situation. \n\nIm a full time paramedic and I do wildfire deployments a few months in total a year. I make great money doing this and im saving for a house, wedding, payoff debt, etc. I plan on doing deployemts for at least 2-3 more years. I won't apply for a 9-5 until I've reached my financial goals.\n\n  \nWhen i finish my degree id like to work in finance in some capacity and during deployments i have a lot of downtime to work remotely so I'm thinking about consulting. \n\n  \nMy long term goal is to move up the hierarchy in corporate finance. I'm thinking after graduation I will pursue financial advisor certifications, see what opportunities there are, and start an MBA.\n\nAny advise on what I can do in the field after I graduate? Or should I wait until I finish my depoyments, degrees, and certs?\n\nThank you all",

        "content": "Commercial Banking Analyst Program Interview\nHey guys. I have an interview for a CB Analyst rotational program at a major bank on Wednesday. I don\u2019t have any charcoal grey or darker navy blue suits or blazers but I have a blue suit, not sure if the color is too important considering it\u2019s a video interview. \n\nI\u2019m told none of the interviews for round 1 and 2 after the HireVue (which I thought I completely blew) would be technical at all, all soft-skills based. I\u2019ve been studying some concepts such as the Five C\u2019s and credit ratios and also have knowledge from a Financial Accounting course I took a couple of months ago. I think I\u2019m prepared for a small amount of technical questions but it does garner some worry on my end if they go any deeper. \n\nAny advice?",

It was a regional bank so take this with a grain of salt, the technical interview was very surface level and while they will expect you to know certain things they won\u2019t try to keep digging into you for more in depth answers. The types of questions I was asked were how purchasing equipment would flow through the 3 financial statements (assuming 100% cash and also 100% financed), I was asked about the C\u2019s of credit, what are the common forms of collateral, they also didn\u2019t specifically ask for ratios but they ask \u201cwhat do you look for when analyzing a potential deal\u201d and this is where you can cover the 5 C\u2019s and ratios. And tbh that was basically it and I even fumbled the 3 financial statements question due to pressure. Just don\u2019t overthink it, review what you know, look at Glassdoor for potential questions they could ask and prepare something for that too. \n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about the suit, as long as you look good in the camera no one will care. Best of luck!",

It was the one and only grad job I applied for since I wasn\u2019t actually a graduate at that stage and had to tie up the end of uni during my first 6 months on the job, but I made it in as their one and only hire and have been here since.\n\nThe hours are very reasonable (basically just 8:30-5 with a 50 hour week here or there), the pay is pretty average (equivalent of 46k USD though with the benefit of living in a comparatively low CoL city in Australia i.e. not Sydney or Melbourne), but there is a strong visibility toward more within a couple years. \n\nThe exposure is pretty great as far as I\u2019m aware, I probably meet with ~5 or so PE/VC/Infra managers a week as they pine for our funds and I\u2019m developing quite a solid \nawareness of how each of those types of investment managers operate, as well as a few connections. \n\nPension funds and SWFs are obviously a pretty big deal globally, and it does fall under what most would consider as \u2018high finance\u2019, at least as I see it, yet I never see it mentioned on this sub. \n\nWhat\u2019s people\u2019s thoughts on the sector?

In my experience they won't ask super technical questions, they'll more try to feel you out and stress test whether you're legit and can handle the level of rigor / stress\n+ Everything on your resume is fair game for extremely in-depth questioning; if you listed any company on your resume ie doing a dcf of their price, it's not unlikely that GS helped advise that deal, and you will be asked extremely specific questions about what happened and why the company chose to do what it did\n+ contrary to popular sentiment I actually found the folks at GS pretty upbeat (excl trading floor), so smile and laugh during the interview and act like a normal person",

Reality is no one is going to be asking you to build models or pick stocks for them. Instead would focus more on how asset management has evolved and clients needs have changed.

Much easier to pivot into something different when you're already succeeding than it is to waste time worrying about it before you apply yourself. That uncertainty is what holds most people back, most people don't have a clue what they want to do.\n\nIf you genuinely find real-estate interesting, look into career options beyond being a broker. Large developers, REITs, etc often have summer internships you can start aiming for. If your faculty has any finance specific degree/career counselling you should sign up for it. Talk to your professors, not all of them will be helpful, but they will know better than most what pathways make sense and will give you the most opportunities when you graduate.",

I\u2019ve been involved in driving growth, optimizing revenue, and establishing meaningful relationships, and I\u2019ve had the privilege of working on impactful projects with major brands.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m finding the transition challenging because, as a new consultant, I don\u2019t yet have a portfolio of case studies to showcase. How do I establish trust with potential clients when I don\u2019t have a history of consulting work to lean on? I know the value I can bring from my background, and the work excites me, but I\u2019m unsure how to bridge that gap and build credibility quickly.\n\nTo give some context on the services I\u2019m offering, I specialize in:\n\t\u2022\tDeveloping go-to-market strategies\n\t\u2022\tBusiness development and account direction\n\t\u2022\tStrategic partnerships and revenue optimization\n\t\u2022\tBrand and tech-focused strategy and innovation\n\nMy target market includes mid-tier to large companies, particularly in sectors like tech, CPG, and creative industries, where I can help businesses expand their pipelines, reduce CAC, and drive growth through innovation and strategic alliances. I\u2019m also passionate about helping brands optimize their partnerships to maximize revenue while aligning with their long-term vision.\n\nAny advice on how to establish myself as a trusted advisor without case studies would be greatly appreciated. Also, feedback on my service offerings and target audience would be incredibly helpful as I continue to refine my approach.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights anything helps!\n\nTo clarify: I\u2019m looking to freelance not get hired by a firm! I\u2019m just wondering if my services make sense and bring value in theory!

He is in finance and making a lot of money, like 5x or more my salary and this will increase fast.\n\nMy career has always been important to me and I definitely fought to be where I am. I always thought I would move to high finance like PE, and it turns out I am doing extremely well in interviews for these jobs, but now when it is time to exit consulting I am leaning more and more towards a corp. strategy role I have been offered.\n\nMy rational arguments for corporate are that I have had (more lately) a lot of shitty moments in consulting and the stress really started getting to me - I was very close to burnout at one point. I just started to think that maybe I am not the career woman that I thought - not all are physically designed for those high paying jobs, and PE will be worse (this is at least what I am constantly telling myself - not sure if this is true). But I am so afraid that I will regret this in the future? I cannot get away from the feeling that I unconsciously made that decision because i felt \u201cwe will be rich anyways\u201d and \u201cI will never reach his salary level so why bother\u201d. It is like I have unconsciously taken this decision because I am taking for granted that we will stay together forever, but that is never guaranteed so it shouldn\u2019t be part of my decision..

I work in corporate strategy (for clients, through a large firm, so essentially I'm an imbedded employee with the same 40 hour weeks and regular holidays) after coming out of consulting, so I have 2 data points. \n\nFor me, the comp is about the same ($275k/year) but my job is extremely chill. The clients are easy to impress; propose the most obvious, logical idea to them that will save time and money and they look at you like you just invented fire. I was in consulting before and the stress was 3X and hours 1.5X at least. I've got a vacation coming up, the client wasn't on top of their deliveries to me and now wants a bunch of stuff turned around in short order that I would have already completed, had they not blown past the deadlines I gave them. My boss literally told me \"don't sweat it. Don't check your email the entire week. Their lack of planning is not your emergency\". It's a very different mentality than consulting or some PE firms, where folks feel they can take advantage of you in some manufactured \"emergency\" that really was lack of planning on lots of procrastination.   \n\nA friend of mine went the consulting-PE route. She was making a lot of money at KKR, but after 3 years, quit after she just couldn't take it anymore. The money wasn't worth being miserable. She now makes almost what I do working deals for a smaller investment CRE firm, has very little stress in her life, and is in a much better place. \n\nIf status (needing to tell everyone \"I work in private equity\") and money (very high levels of compensation) are important to you, that's probably the route to go. A lot of MBB-PE folks are highly insecure and driven to be identifed by their professions and job titles. That's OK. But you've got to be OK with the lifestyle and stress that comes with it. Others are OK with a good salary that can support a family, a normal work life, and plenty of time to enjoy things. \n\nI look at it this way: the difference between the two lifestyles is between going on a ski vacation, renting out a condo for $300 a night and not working vs. going on a ski vacation, staying at the Ritz Carlton for $1700 a night, and getting pulled into meetings and presentation reviews while you are on vacation. Is staying at the Ritz worth the tradeoff of working much of my vacation week and not getting to be on the hill or hang out with my family? For me; a bed is just a bed as long as it's comfy. I'm there to ski and be outdoors. \n\nOthers need that \"I'm important (the work can't wait till I get back) and I have lots of money\" validation of their worth.",

                "content": "It's tricky because it feels like in the past 6 years, everything has become overwrought. \n\nPre-COVID, it was rare to see interview processes take so many rounds, with so much uncertainty to move ahead. Depended on position, of course, but when I was interviewing (ultimately didn't follow through), there'd be a couple of phone conversations (no video, so didn't matter how you dressed or where you did it), then a \"big\" in-person interview round, and *maybe* a followup interview with someone important who couldn't make it. That's it. The employer and you made your decision based on that information, full stop.\n\nIn addition, I think there was a bit more respect for the challenges of the consultant lifestyle. So as a candidate you'd be given more freedom to schedule the phone calls at a mutually convenient time. And the prospective employer, if they were experienced at recruiting from consulting, would cheerfully schedule the in-person interview on a Friday, unless you told them something else worked. \n\nFrom talking to people now, candidates just have to jump more at the prospective employer's whim, and employers are a lot more indecisive before committing to hire someone.\n\nFinally, in my time, I think there was more acceptance of the fact that consultants were always looking and/or being approached by recruiters. So, while you wouldn't trumpet it from the treetops, a lot of consultants felt fine privately sharing with their team that's what was going on, without it implying they were \"no longer committed\". And while 4 days a week on client site was the norm, there were all sorts of reasons why someone might need to shorten their on-site some week, and as long as they got their work done and *someone* on the team was providing on-site coverage, it was (usually) ok.",

        "content": "Need advice for getting out of a career rut in industry\nI\u2019m a former management consultant who started my career in MENA but was fired after being outed. After years of unemployment, I managed to claw my way back into an in-house strategy team at a Fortune 500 company as a Sr Analyst.\n\nI was hired for a \"too big to fail\" mega tech project with a clear end date. I\u2019m also a full-stack engineer, and early on, I pointed out that the value assumptions of the project was fundamentally flawed\u2014its hypothesis was incorrect, tech was undeliverable and its measurable value was close to zero. While officially doing slide work for my manager (which never landed due to incorrect technical assumptions misaligned with business strategy and needs), I worked in the background to untangle the convoluted mess. My manager is an ex-MBB who struggles with basic mac functions and any tool invented after 1996.\n\nIt was incredibly frustrating. There was a \"potato\" on the table, yet everyone was convinced it was an \"orange,\" and we were expected to deliver \"orange juice\", despite the business having zero appetite for it. Naturally, my manager was dissatisfied with me. I kept insisting that delivering anything valuable was impossible. They only cared about managing up of course and they gave me a negative performance rating. Unlike in consulting, I had no option to get staffed on another project.\n\nShortly after, the company created a transformation office and shuffled us there from strategy. The talent level is abysmal compared to strategy, no projects will be in a deliverable state for at least four years, and there are minimal opportunities for facetime with senior leadership.\n\nOn the other hand, I was proven right. Leadership finally acknowledged that the original hypothesis and value proposition were bogus. Thanks to my background work (where I built a model to make \"French fries\" from the \"potato\" instead\u2014something the business actually wanted), we now have something tangible. The new transformation leader, of course, took the credit and presented it to their superiors since nothing else under the transformation is remotely deliverable for foreseeble future.\n\nInternally, I have no room to maneuver due to a lack of facetime and working under cardboard cutout managers who have no interest in my career growth. In fact, it\u2019s against their interest to help me move\u2014if I leave, my role won\u2019t be backfilled due to redundancy, and they\u2019ll lose their managerial perks. It\u2019s common here to have VPs reporting to VPs, with just one or two analysts under them. I want to return to strategy, but HR will keep blocking me due to internal politics (that I mentioned above), preferred candidates, and the convenient excuse of \"this person is doing transformation and not strat\".\n\nExternally, my CV is all over the place due to the moves I\u2019ve made. My current role also doesn\u2019t allow for external networking the way strategy does, where those opportunities were more frequent.\n\nThat said, my stakeholder management, problem-solving, and technical skills are top-notch. I have no interest in transformation work (especially for this business), and growth prospects in this role and team are close to zero. I can already feel the atrophy setting in.\n\nOn the plus side, the pay isn\u2019t terrible. If I don\u2019t try to solve the problems, my job takes less than 10 hours a week, with only about an hour of stakeholder interaction (mostly with middle management). Whenever I push my manager for more, he just points to job security as the main perk and is surprised that I want something beyond that. For them, as an ex-MBB, this is probably a dream job\u2014managing a single person, pulling in near-partner-level comp, and the comfort of delivering nothing while not being accountable for it.\n\nI\u2019m a workaholic and honestly miss my consulting days, where I was always on the move. That might sound odd to those trying to land an in-house strategy or transformation job here, but as a fair warning\u2014corporate is so inefficient that the government could probably run things better.\n\nOn the flipside, I have strong leadership traits, and I\u2019m ambitious and entrepreneurial. I naturally take the initiative while everyone else stands frozen like a deer in headlights. I often make people uncomfortable because I ask provocative questions that cut straight to the root of the problem. I think my tolerance for BS has diminished with age and life experience.\n\nI\u2019m self-aware enough to recognize that I\u2019ve made mistakes\u2014like actually trying to solve problems, which my manager sees as a flaw. Putting two and two together, I\u2019m probably a better fit for a startup (especially since I can do both strategy and code full-stack ), but coming from big corporate is a tough sell in the limited EU startup scene.",

The decision was made way above your pay grade and likely long before you were given your assignment that it was an orange. How can you expect to win the support and praise of the people who will promote or fire you if you're actively working to make them fail at delivering what they're accountable for?\n\nCompanies/customers/stakeholders do this all the time. They have shitty ideas and even shittier middle managers who can't execute. They're not going to just quit and hand things over to people who can do it better than them. To them, there *is* nobody who can do it better than them, and if they failed it's because somebody didn't do their job. You're making yourself a really easy target for that.\n\nYou need to learn to operate and influence within the existing power structure. There isn't a single competent manager out there that is ever going to say, \"actually guys, this time it was all /u/LadyLaurelin, completely their idea and they should get all the credit for it!\" and if a manager ever did that with one of my wins I'd probably immediately think to myself shit, I need to get a new manager ASAP. \n\nI don't think your ideas are necessarily wrong, they just won't get the business outcomes that you think they will. Do you want to solve problems or do you want to get paid? I competely understand either answer, but this is /r/consulting. You're in the wrong line of work if you want to make a meaningful difference in the world.\n\nYour flaw isn't that you try to solve problems, your flaw is that you put yourself at odds with your team.",

Living in a country thats been hit hard by recession, news of thousands being laid off weekly,  I found myself out of work (IT Consultant Principal consultant and GTM Digital Specialist B2B). After applying for 30 jobs with no response it became clear to me that a White guy in his late 50s is not going to get past firstly AI and secondly the DEI empowered HR graduate. So I analysed my core strengths and how they reflected into the market - basically when was I in the zone - knowing I was delivering significant value. I bottled this into 4 propositions and approached 6 senior managers at separate  organisations that I had worked with previously and asked for their advice and feedback. 5 out of 6 said they had problems I could fix. One offered me my first contract. Fast forward 9 months I have 3 clients. Making 40% more than what I was in previous role. Doing 4 day weeks. Am very optimistic about this approach - I know it doesnt suit everyone - but off to a promising start. Interesting final note - I found my work ethic didnt change I just felt liberated from working for really self centred and often incompetent managers.",

A hyper focus on the next promotion can be detrimental to your long term career trajectory (trust me, I know).\nFind out what makes your work day great, what makes you bit want to leave for the day because you find the work so interesting - that will give you the drive to succeed - then broaden your horizon when it comes to compensation. Regularly apply to jobs that you expect will genuinely make you happy, and estimate what you are worth, if your current firm is not compensating you fairly, raise this or take another kob",

Ask for a clear set of milestones for promotion at every level and review with your line manager when you cross those milestones throughout the year.

It\u2019s been nearly a decade so I understand a lot has changed. ",

Otherwise you can create tech debt on day 1. If you have a POS, you probably have an ERP and should consider how the reporting will look in 12-24 months and what the org might ask for. All that being said, I would recommend hiring a firm. Depending on your budget, there are plenty of niche firms that could stand up a very simple data warehouse and reporting in 4-6 months (conservative estimate bc I do not know your env).",

That firm is now going out of business, and the bank wants to keep me, but they don\u2019t have a direct position available yet. To bridge the gap, they\u2019re funneling me through a staffing agency temporarily until they can create a role for me.\n\nThe problem is, the staffing agency wants me to sign a non-solicit agreement that prevents me from seeking employment with any of their customers. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also interviewing for a full-time role at another bank through their standard hiring process. This bank is a customer of the staffing agency. \n\nIf I sign with the staffing agency but later get a direct offer from the second bank, could this cause issues during the background check? Specifically, would the bank see my connection to the staffing agency and back off, assuming there\u2019s a conflict?\n\nI know non-solicits aren\u2019t always enforceable, but my concern is that even the appearance of a conflict could scare the bank into rescinding the offer. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How likely is this to cause problems?\n\n",

My mind is just totally blank. Ideas always just came to me when I needed them. But its not happening anymore. And trying to think through new ideas gets me nowhere.  \n\nI just got approval to hire 2 new analysts under me which should be a massive help but even with that light at the end of the tunnel I feel completely hopeless on the immediate deliverables that I need to get done between now and when they are finally hired and trained. \n\nEven as I sit here, taking a step back and outlining the slides I need to get done for a presentation tomorrow--none of which are very complex or novel--I cant even envision them being completed.

I enjoy my job, I'm pretty good at it, and I don\u2019t experience too much stress overall. However, I go through cycles where I struggle with intense anxiety when speaking in public.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that I\u2019ve done theater my whole life, and I\u2019m actually a strong presenter. So, my fear isn\u2019t about presenting itself\u2014it\u2019s about my voice. When I start speaking, my voice sometimes trembles (typically in the beginning of the presentation), and that immediately triggers stress. In other words, I\u2019m not anxious about the presentation; I\u2019m anxious about the possibility of my voice betraying me.\n\nI absolutely hate this, and I feel like it\u2019s starting to hold back my career progression. I want to become a PM, but how can I lead confidently if I look nervous while speaking? I\u2019ve tried several approaches to fix this:\n\nShort-term physical: Slow breathing techniques before and during presentations, hydration, vocal warm-ups, smiling,\u2026\n\nLong-term physical: Regular exercise, good sleep habits\n\nLong-term mental: Saw a psychologist, but general advice about controlling cortisol didn\u2019t really help\n\nShort-term mental: This has worked best so far\u2014before speaking, I recall positive experiences from past presentations and theater performances, focusing on the enjoyment and confidence I felt\n\nBut it\u2019s still not enough. I'm really looking for any advice\u2014does anyone else deal with this? How do you manage it? I mean, there are news anchors and public speakers who do this daily\u2014there must be techniques to keep your voice under control.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any insights\u2014I'm getting quite desperate!",

                "content": "Here\u2019s another excerpt specifically about speaking\n\n\u201c\u00a0A similar case, dealing, however, with speaking rather than writing, was related to me by a colleague in the Laryngological Department of the Vienna Poliklinik Hospital. It was the most severe case of stuttering he had come across in his many years of practice. Never in his life, as far as the stutterer could remember, had he been free from his speech trouble, even for a moment, except once. This happened when he was twelve years old and had hooked a ride on a streetcar. When caught by the conductor, he thought that the only way to escape would be to elicit his sympathy, and so he tried to demonstrate that he was just a poor stuttering\u00a0boy. At that moment, when he tried to stutter, he was unable to do it. Without meaning to, he had practiced paradoxical intention, though not for therapeutic purposes. \u201c\n\n\nNote, this technique can be applied in many cases, and for me it actually really helped curing my sleeplessness. When I lay my head on the pillow now, I say \u201cI\u2019m going to try to stay awake for as long as I can\u201d and of course, I fall asleep. As he explains:\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u00a0Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness results in a hyper- intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep\u201c",

Sometimes that results in an ask for support on a particular problem.\n\nI do both technology strategy and transformation so I\u2019m in it for the long run. Good projects align incentives between both parties, especially when the consultancy is correctly incentivised in line with the clients broader goals. This can go into the contract, but agreements really vary. Some will be T&M, some will be fixed price with set deliverables, some will have benefit sharing where certain conditions need to be met to get full pay/more pay. None are perfect.\n\nIf you\u2019re just delivering guidance then in the short term it doesn\u2019t massively matter how you perform, but many clients will demand rework if work is sub par. Beyond the short term you shaft yourself as you build a reputation for failing to deliver to the right standard, you\u2019ll struggle to buy from those stakeholders or even that org again, and it damages the reputation of the consultancy.\n\nSome firms may focus on short term gains as part of their strategy and try to grow themselves out of the problem but it isn\u2019t sustainable. Good leaders will protect against this but it gets very political very fast if the leaders have the wrong incentives (e.g. pushing for quick IPO so they can cash out/short vest period).",

Over the course of **6 months**:\n\n* I developed and executed their marketing strategy\n* I ran Google Ads campaigns + created landing pages\n* I oversaw CRM migration (\\~6,000 records), and automation\n* I reduced their CRM and ad management costs by over 90%\n* I created content based on psychographic profiles and managed campaigns across LinkedIn and email\n* I delivered consistent, measurable performance improvements\n\nI charged just **$35/hr** and worked **65+ hours per month**. Payments were delayed from the start, but after the first few months, I finally received partial payment. However, for the **last three months**, I was **never paid** \u2014 over **$7,000 owed**.\n\nAfter weeks of chasing payment, the client eventually claimed my work was \u201csubstandard\u201d (which was never raised during the engagement), and offered me an ultimatum:\n\n>\n\nNo written feedback, no dispute process, just that. I\u2019ve now exhausted polite follow-ups and have decided to go public \u2014 within the bounds of NDAs and professionalism \u2014 to **warn other consultants and freelancers**.\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 Lessons Learned:\n\n* **Insist on weekly or milestone payments**\n* Get everything in writing, especially feedback or scope changes\n* If a client delays payment early, don\u2019t assume it\u2019ll get better\n* Keep access to critical deliverables until payments are cleared\n\nHave any of you been in a similar situation?  \nWould love to hear how you handled it \u2014 or any tips for escalation when legal action isn't worth the time/cost.\n\nStay safe out there, and protect your time \u270a",

If you have your contract in writing, which I presume you do, why wouldn't you enforce it in small claims court?\n\nIf it's $7k, it's worth pursuing. And the majority of the time the thread of legal action prompts people to pay.\n\nAnd even if they claim the work is sub-standard, they can't say they won't pay for ANY of it. They have to make a fair deduction. So go immediately to small claims court.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n**1**. **Determine if the amount falls within small claims court for your jurisdiction** (it almost certainly does at $7k)\n\n**2. Gather your evidence.**\n\n* **Contract/Agreement** (if written)\n* **Invoices and Payment Terms**\n* **Emails/Text Messages** showing agreed work and payment issues\n* **Proof of Work Delivered** (reports, access logs, screenshots)\n* **Any Admission of Debt** from the client\n\n**3. Send a final demand letter.**\n\n* Before filing, courts often require you to attempt to resolve the dispute.\n* Send a **final demand letter** via email and registered mail stating:\n   * The amount owed\n   * The work completed\n   * A deadline (e.g., 7\u201314 days) to pay before legal action\n   * That you will pursue small claims if unpaid\n\n**4. File the claim**\n\n* Find the correct **small claims court** based on where the client is located.\n* Fill out the required **claim form** (usually online).\n* Pay a **filing fee** (ranges from $20\u2013$200, often recoverable if you win).\n* Serve the **legal notice** to the client (court rules specify how).\n\n**5. Attend the hearing.**\n\n* The client may settle before the hearing.\n* If not, both parties present their case (briefly).\n* The judge will make a ruling, often on the same day.\n* The cost is usually a few hundred dollars, which is recoverable if you win.",

Each senior person you know could change your  career with a nice connection , recommendation or program sold. Whatever. \n2. Fun - it\u2019s just fun - let\u2019s say it. Life should be fun as well \n3. Gray hair - it gives you 1-2 more years to mature. Careers in consulting MBB is really accelerated. You find yourself very senior at a very young age. If you are not mature enough - you will fail. Being mature when selling to CEOs helps. You actually see high flying MBB senior partners getting there at 40-42 years old only to then fail spectacularly and burnout with big life crisis and change careers simply because they were just not mature enough - they got there too fast",

Since you\u2019re likely returning to the MBB you came from, you don\u2019t have to recruit and you will have SO much time to do whatever you couldn\u2019t over the last few years of consulting. I played a lot of tennis, became fitter and travelled a lot \n2. You can truly enjoy education since you can choose what you want to study for the most part and you won\u2019t be obligated to take courses to further your career or build hard skills \n3. Global friend circle (or network, depends on you look at it). Whichever popular country I travel to now, I have a friend(s) I look forward to catching up with \n4. Definitely helps when you\u2019re exiting. While MBB compensates for the basic requirements of most exit options, \u2018preferred\u2019 qualifications often include an MBA, so it mayyy give your cv a slight boost \n\nI could have been promoted a year earlier if I didn\u2019t do my MBA, but even with the benefit of hindsight would I change my decision? Nope. Strongly recommend it if it\u2019s paid for. \n\nIf it\u2019s not paid for, however, then I\u2019d say you need to take a more considered decision taking into account scholarships, opportunity cost, comfortable savings etc.",

If youre already pulling in $175k+ then the opportunity cost of going full time is just astronomical and you should be looking at an evening or executive program because your likely exit job salaries are not going to be \u201cthat much\u201d higher.

At this point in time, if youre wanting another degree just to be more qualified, I\u2019d recommend getting a masters in statistics or data analysis.

I joined BCG aged \\~32 with 12 years' prior experience in the IT industry, starting initially at BCG in a specialist role and then moving into the generalist consulting track as a Consultant (equivalent to post-MBA hire). I considered doing an MBA for the breadth of general business skills I'd pick up, plus the network-building. However I eventually decided against it because:\n\n1. I was already at the post-MBA job step at BCG, so whilst it might have helped with trajectory, it wouldn't have directly unlocked a promotion\n2. Big opportunity cost - even if I could have got BCG to sponsor the B-school fees, the opportunity cost of losing 1-2 years' income would have been a big hit at a life-stage (married with 3 kids) when I had lots of outgoings\n3. BCG offered an alternative \"micro-MBA\" called the Business Essentials Program, which is/was a 3 week course, taught by top tier lecturers (think HBS professors like Clayton Christensen at the time), with about 50% of the time spent on financial accounting (understanding a balance sheet & P&L), management accounting (business cases, IRR, ROI etc.), and the remaining time on a lightning tour of manufacturing, ops, marketing, IT, strategy, etc. It taught the bare essentials on each topic, and enough of the rest to know what you didn't know. Very useful for industry hires like me.\n\nLooking back after 25 years with the firm and making it to Partner & Director, I'm happy with my decision.\n\nTalking recently with a Senior Associate at Bain (2 years out of undergrad), I think the idea of a secondment (to understand more of what it's really like in a line role in industry) \\*and\\* an MBA is a great way of both developing yourself and broadening your horizons, especially if you can get your firm to sponsor you.",

These advisory services projects are generally only 8-10 weeks or less. I think looking at churn trends is still good, but my leadership team is looking for shorter term KPIs to indicate how successful each engagement is. \n\nIm at a bit of a loss. Every project is different. Some customers just need a few hours of training, some need to make strategic changes, and some need complete relaunches. Some just need handholding. \n\nNotably, my leadership team doesn\u2019t want to send a CSAT survey. I\u2019m thinking CSAT is the only option aside from identifying project specific KPIs but I really need a consistent metric. Identifying a new success measurement for each project isn\u2019t reasonable. \n\nWith renewal rates and CSATs not on the table, I could use some advice please. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb \n\nThanks in advance \n\n",

From the start, I knew I wasn\u2019t in it for the long haul\u2014my goal was to learn the toolkit, stay for 1-2 years, and then move on. Lately, though, I\u2019ve been thinking about the relationships I\u2019ve (or haven\u2019t) built here and how I\u2019ll be leaving without feeling like I\u2019ve really left a mark.\n\nIn my previous experiences\u2014internships in IB, VC, and startups\u2014I realized that what truly lasts after any role are the relationships you build. Even today, I\u2019m still close to people of varying seniority levels from those places. But here, it feels different.\n\nFor the seniors (MDPs, etc.), it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even exist. There\u2019s little sense of mentorship, and it feels like juniors are just passing through. With peers (PLs and below), I find it hard to connect beyond the surface. Everyone seems \u201cpolished,\u201d and there\u2019s little room to show your real personality. Even outside of work, conversations often feel guarded\u2014like people are still holding onto their \u201cprofessional\u201d selves. Some complain about the job off the record, but it feels more like a way to vent than an actual reflection of deeper conversations or connections.\n\nIt\u2019s strange because consulting is supposed to be a team sport, but paradoxically, it feels quite inhuman. Sure, I\u2019ve built some connections on projects, but nothing like the brotherhood I experienced in past roles.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\t\u2022\tAm I the only one feeling this way?\n\t\u2022\tFor those who\u2019ve left, is there anything you wish you had done differently to build stronger connections?\n\t\u2022\tOr, for those who did succeed in this, how did you make the most of your time here and the people you met? What those relationships brought you in your careers? \n\nReally looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.",

There's also the whole hunger games aspect if it - your peers are also your competition.\u00a0\n\n\nI am not in touch with many people (left after 2.5 years) - half of those I wanted to keep close to were still working the crazy MBB hours and didn't have time.

So most people will feel like they didn\u2019t develop deep connections particularly as experienced hires. Under five years, you develop deep connection if you joined straight out of undergrad or straight out of post-grad from one of the top schools (then people like to take you under their wing). When you\u2019ve worked for five years plus, you start becoming more integrated into select pyramids. When that happens, leaders have your back. They want you, and will sponsor you. Similarly, you start having others\u2019 backs. You are viewed as a leader to the new joiners. And your eco-system naturally starts to develop. But your overall observation is correct - it\u2019s challenging to find those relationships here and people remain guarded.",

        "content": "Snapped at by Client PM\nBackground:\nIT consulting, Consultant on short term T&M project delivering SQL views and dashboard with super involved business logic and many data requirements.\n\nI have a multi-year history working with this client on a long term staff aug, they tried (and almost succeeded) in poaching me from my firm.\n\nI realized the deadline given to us by the client was not going to be attainable about 2/3 through our budget and timeline (I know this realization was way too late). I have one junior resource working under me full time, with me on several hours per week providing oversight and support.\n\nWe are running out of budget with the deliverable promised not complete, and likely won\u2019t be complete, and I need to relay that to my stakeholders at the business.\n\n\nSituation:\nThis PM I am working with was hired when I was on the staff aug, he is technically competent and from what I can tell a decent project manager. I\u2019ve worked with him onsite and our relationship has been cordial and collaborative.\n\nThat is, until this meeting today: \nI set up some time this afternoon to discuss some of our outstanding items, getting the internal team on the same page to prep for the meeting with my stakeholders. Making sure we are all on the same page with what we don\u2019t know, so I can escalate and convey what we will be able to deliver (we run out of budget in 3 weeks and I need to set expectations).\n\nThe meeting was derailed almost immediately - the client PM wanted us to restructure one of our deliverables that had been already completed. I pushed back, being direct, as we don\u2019t have enough time to hit our original scope as-is.\n\nI let him know that I would have to escalate to our client point of contact (PM\u2019s boss) and discuss how we should spend our time, whether it be on this or something else, and if this is what they want me to be working on, which seemed like professional courtesy.\n\nThe PM took exception to this - I\u2019m not sure whether by something I said or how I said it - but he shot back with \u201cyou seem to be forgetting something, I am the PM on the project\u201d. Basically saying \u201cdon\u2019t escalate\u201d, tone was hostile and it was in front of my junior resource.\n\nI\u2019ve never been spoken to by a client that way, it caught me off guard.\n\nThe PM doesn\u2019t control my team\u2019s hours, I\u2019m ultimately accountable to my stakeholders.\n\nThe Result:\nI let my project manager know (also my boss) - who let me know if the client PM has a bad experience working with our team, it\u2019s a problem. Was hoping for a little more support or feedback honestly but I didn\u2019t get much more than that.\n\nI\u2019ve since reached out to the PM just quickly explaining I have to be aligned with my PM and the client PM\u2019s boss - I also included the client PM in the meeting to get aligned on timeline / expectations.\n\n\nGetting snapped at by an otherwise friendly colleague was jarring - obviously something I never want to have happen as a consultant. I could understand if me escalating to his boss could be toe stepping, but I also have to make sure the chain of command is aligned.\n\nDid I fuck up here??",

        "content": "Feeling Stuck\nHi all, I\u2019m a 24-year-old consultant based in Europe.\n\nI\u2019ve been working at a pharma/biotech consulting firm for the past couple of years. I started as an entry-level analyst and was promoted after two years. Lately, though, I\u2019ve been questioning whether this job and firm are still right for me:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Feeling Isolated and Disconnected\n\nMost clients are in the US since the EU offices are still new. As a result I often work on US-based projects with EU hours, which means long days (10\u201312 hours) behind a screen, waiting for feedback from US-based teams/managers and partners. Even when I go to the office, I\u2019m stuck on calls with US colleagues, so face-to-face interaction is rare. The lack of in-person collaboration\u2014grabbing coffee, brainstorming as a team\u2014has really hurt my motivation and productivity compared to when I\u2019ve worked with local colleagues.\n\n2.\tQuestioning the value of work\n\nThe work used to feel strategic and meaningful. Now I realize it\u2019s mostly glorified (and expensive) market research with questionable data and conclusions dressed up as \u201cstrategic recommendations.\u201d What once felt impactful now feels hollow.\n\n3.\tFrustration with the Process\n\nThe hypocrisy on some projects is hard to ignore. I\u2019ve been working non-stop with a partner who\u2019s is revered by all, but behind the scenes, the data is often manipulated to fit the narrative. Forecasts from market research are too low and the client\u2019s job is on the line? Just \u201cstrategically\u201d tweak the model to inflate revenue projections. But miss a footnote on a draft slide? Prepare to be dragged through endless revisions. It feels like we\u2019re adding fake value to cover up the fact that the work itself isn\u2019t delivering real insights and is mostly overpriced and unreliable market research\n\n4.\tPoor Exit Opportunities\n\nGood exits from this office have been rare. I suspect it\u2019s partly the job market and slower hiring cycles in Europe, but I also think working with US-based clients limits opportunities. Minimal client interaction, no site visits, and weak networking chances with local clients make it hard to transition to a good role in Europe. Since my long-term plan is to exit, I\u2019m questioning whether staying makes sense.\n\nDespite all this, I\u2019ve consistently gotten strong reviews and am on track for another promotion\n\nA month ago, something changed. I suddenly went from managing 12-hour days and producing good work to feeling mentally drained and slow. Tasks that were once easy now take twice as long, and I am making mistakes and being inconclusive. It feels like I can\u2019t even put together a decent slide anymore. I\u2019ve tried compensating by working longer hours, but that\u2019s only made things worse. My anxiety has spiked\u2014I\u2019m constantly stressed, to the points where I start sweating randomly and panicking before calls.\n\nI feel stuck in a job the value of which I am seriously debating and I\u2019m starting to fall behind. I\u2019m not sure what to do next: \u2022\tA) Stay and try to turn things around. \u2022\tB) Stay in consulting but to to a firm working on projects I\u2019d enjoy more (e.g., corporate strategy). \u2022\tC) Try to lateral into industry \u2014but with the current market, that feels unlikely.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? Any insights would be really helpful.",

There is also the added complication that mistakes from the past do come back to haunt you and that it takes time for results to percolate through the inertia inside every large organisation \nBut I am much happier now.

I also talked to the other woman about \u201chey maybe we should send out an email a few days before we order things so we can hear from everyone if there are any requests.\u201d She thought that was a good idea; I don\u2019t think it had even occurred to her before.\n\nI also suggested we could do a poll at the start of the month for people to vote on their preferred restaurants to order from that month, and make sure I stay on top of getting all the lunches in. Also, I suggested we should email everyone a few days ahead of time and let them know when an office lunch will happen so people can come into the office that day if they want to be there for the catered lunch. (She has been announcing lunches by going around the morning of and just letting people know she\u2019s getting lunch that day.)\n\nWe all had a really fun conversation one Friday about what was cool when we were in high school (wide range of ages in the office), so I brought in a whiteboard and put it in the kitchen with a question of the week to spur more conversations. It\u2019s worked well, and a couple of people who don\u2019t usually work out of our office have even stopped by to answer.\n\nI had a mini duck on my desk because my teen loves to hide them around and gave me one. A woman in the office saw it and was so excited thinking we were doing a \u201cduck hunt\u201d in the office. I told her unfortunately no, it was just one from my teen, but I bought a pack of ducks this weekend to surprise the office with and start a duck hunt.\n\nWhat are some other ways I can bring some levity and happiness into the office like this? We have a great company, we just need a more fun office. \n",

I\u2019ve been with this firm for about 4 years.  I\u2019ve begun to notice a pattern of boys club behavior in my office but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being overly sensitive or if it\u2019s real.  \n\nI was recently last one to know about a teammates 3rd promotion (we were hired on the same day), this year I was left out of bonus and the conversation around it (we had 3x revenue than previous years), they socialize outside of work, frequently go to lunch together, they have a pattern of waiting till I leave for the day to go out for expensive meals or drinks together (I\u2019m responsible for reconciling these cc charges), they easily banter with each other in front of me and behind closed doors, it goes on and on.  \n\nMy reviews are always great and in previous years my bonuses were substantial as was my work load. We\u2019re all about the same age and as much as I get along with each teammate on an individual basis, I can\u2019t figure out why my boss has started to exclude me as part of the team.  Something  switched and the doors started to literally close and I was shut out.  \n\nI have repeatedly asked my boss if I had done something because the shift is palpable and he insists nothings wrong, everything great yet he\u2019s got no time for me anymore, my ideas get pushed to the side, my colleagues are constantly praised in group meetings while my contributions to our revenue stream goes unnoticed, Now I\u2019m fetching coffees and lunches, keeping calendars, being the last to know anything, doing all the simple stuff. and the good ole\u2019 boys club behavior continues. \n\nSo\u2026 long story longer, I\u2019m at a loss.  I get paid well, I love doing what I do and I good at it.  I like my female counterparts (we\u2019re scattered across the country, but I don\u2019t trust that venting to them won\u2019t get back to my boss ) and my contributions are valued/recognized  at the corp level. There are no other internal opportunities in my current city, I can\u2019t move to corp HQ.  I don\u2019t feel like complaining to HR will make any difference and might even make things worse for me.  So what do I do?  Is it me?  Am I being overly sensitive?  Is it really time to move on?

Unfortunately these kinds of behaviors don\u2019t correct themselves unless there is a big shift in the environment, say, losing the ring leader, adding another woman to the team. \n\nYou have been brave and sensible enough to ask outright what\u2019s going on and your coworkers and boss have made it clear that you are never going to be inside this group. And your boss thinks you\u2019re being whiney. I don\u2019t think I would enjoy being in this clique even if they let me in. \n\nSeriously consider moving to another job. And when you get there you can prevent this dynamic by asking individuals\u2014-then advance to asking several\u2014-out for lunch/breakfast/drinks. It\u2019s much harder for them to be dismissive if they know you. Use humor, the universal language. (If some asks you to get them coffee, say \u201cSure, for 100 bucks and I\u2019ll need that in advance.\u201d) And bring in a box of donuts sometime in the first month. By offering this advice I am not suggesting \u201cbuying\u201d your way in, just some hints for being neighborly and preemptive. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that when you change jobs you can bump up your salary. And now that u know what a stale office feels like, you can evaluate this too. \n\nWhen you quit, be sure to ask for an exit interview and tell your boss/HR exactly why you are leaving, without any show of emotion. Consider twisting the knife in by saying you loved your job but the atmosphere was not collaborative and comradely and you need that to enjoy your daily work life. No fun doing well in that atmosphere. He may ask you to stay and you can say \u201cThanks but my decision is final\u201d.  Maybe next time he won\u2019t encourage such awful behavior\u2014-he could have nipped it in the bud if he had invited you out to lunch with a few of the offenders. \n\nGood luck!",

Time to get assertive and competitive and less  passive and cooperative.\n\nToday I\u2019ll write down my list of non emotional, non negotiable, and measurable expectations. Tomorrow first thing, I will have a conversation with my boss and state my need to brought back into the office fold and treated as an equal contributor to the team. I don\u2019t necessarily need or want to be part of their after hours club, but they will stop excluding me from any information that is relevant to the job he hired me for.  In return, I will be held to account for my failure and celebrated for my success. If these expectations are acceptable then we will continue to grow and succeed together, otherwise we agree that I will look elsewhere for better opportunities.\n\nEither he will appreciate this approach or his ego will consider me aggressive and belligerent and fire me right there on the spot.

Because men have to occasionally watch what they say and do for fear of being held responsible for their actions and words. \n\nWhy *do* they \"invade\" the spaces of men who just want to be free to act like uncultured trash with no repercussions!? There are no places left where you can do that aside from fraternal organizations, private clubs, athletic clubs, strip clubs, their homes, their friends homes, and anywhere a woman is more than 10 feet away. That's almost nowhere at all. Damn those dangerous \"woman\"!\n\nSo few places in the public square you can do that because of those evil \"woman\" these days. Thinking they can just...go to a public accommodation without being treated like semen receptacles and deaf-mute slaves. The nerve! \n\nThey should realize their place is at home, waiting for their hero to return from his hobbies of staring lecherously at women and telling jokes based in the more humorous aspects of sexual assault. \n\nMaybe if they stayed where they belong and out of men's safe spaces (read: 99% of the goddamn planet) they would get equal pay and the respect you'd give your neighbor's dog, amirite?\n\nThey certainly wouldn't mistake most of what you say as the delusional ranting of a misogynistic dumpster fire if they knew their place and kept to it and away from the safe spaces of men, which are only all the aforementioned male oriented places *and* just  work, theaters, restaurants, bars, stores and open public areas. If they would just leave those to us, everyone could get along splendidly. \n\nIt's all so complicated when women are around. It's like being on camera with nothing in your hands. The interactions get so difficult to navigate!\n\nWhy can't we just be left alone to protect our lives, careers, reputations, and families...from ourselves?",

It was more than enough for a week's worth of supplies, but there were some people in accounting overnight who would just go into the kitchen and steal everything. Paper towels, coffee mugs, you name it. There were office memos that were sent about it, and we even knew who was doing it on camera, but nobody actually did anything. It was pretty bold of them.\n\nSame company, back when desktop computers were all the rage, somebody was stealing the RAM and sound cards out of them. The theft was pretty bad, and a lot of people couldn't do their work because it would boot up their computer and it wouldn't have enough RAM for Windows 95. In that case, it turned out to be the armed guard company that we had overnights.

But I want to keep this job so I\u2019m trying to understand what he wants me to do. \n\nHe\u2019s a busy guy. Hates it when I have questions. If I bother him too much, his whole mood changes and everyone in the office has to deal with him insulting them the rest of the day. So I stopped asking him questions. Then he started getting suspicious to what I was doing and constantly checking up on me. \n\nHe monitors my hours and gets super upset if I clock in so much as a minute late in the morning or after breaks. My time NEEDS to be exactly 40 hours on the dot every week. But, at the same time, he\u2019s constantly telling me I\u2019m wasting company money because I take too long to finish projects. I\u2019m new to the job and still learning, so of course I\u2019m slower than him, who has twenty years on me in this field. And, according to him, I NEED to be clocked in 40 hours every week (paid hourly, not salary). So what is the big deal if I use all of my time on the projects he gives me? (Which arent many. I often have to stretch projects out to appear busy). \n\nI tried to appeal to his ego by joking around and befriending him. That turned out weird. I can crack his composure and make him laugh, but he\u2019s still mean as hell to me every chance he gets. And when I pull back on that because I\u2019m getting nothing out of the camaraderie, he gets butt hurt that I\u2019m ignoring him. \n\nI\u2019m trying so hard and I don\u2019t know what to do. This is the best possible job I can get in the town I live in. So, unless I want to take a big pay cut, I\u2019d have to find a remote job, which isn\u2019t likely. Does he just enjoy messing with me? Am I really that awful as an employee? \n\n",

He's entrenched and you aren't getting anyone to help you to complain to the higher ups. So start looking for a better job even if it means leaving the area you live in. Maybe more education to hone your skills better.",

        "content": "Almost took the wrong job out of desperation. Here are 3 things I wish I knew sooner:\nFour years ago, I was at rock bottom. Let go after a decade. COVID-era layoff. Depressed as hell. I felt like absolute dogshit - like I had wasted my best years and had nothing to show for it. I spent months lying in bed, barely eating, convinced my career was over. My wife? She didn\u2019t buy it. Every day, she\u2019d tell me: \u201cQuit it. You know you can do better.\u201d Over and over. Until one day\u2026I listened.\n\nI almost settled for a garbage job - same pay, worse commute, soul-crushing. But then, by pure accident, I stumbled onto the listing. It was everything. Every requirement? I had it. They needed someone ASAP? I could hit the ground running. It was close to home. No training required. It was so stupidly perfect that it felt unreal.\n\nI told them straight up: \"I can do this job, and I\u2019ll do it damn well. But I have another offer on the table.\" They moved fast. Offered me double. Now? I\u2019m three years in, making three times my old salary, five minutes from my house, working for a company the media calls \u201crecession-proof.\u201d No stress. No job-hunting ever again.\n\nHere\u2019s 3 things I wish I knew back when I was spiraling:\n\n\\- Your brain is a liar when you\u2019re depressed. It tells you you\u2019re worthless, that you\u2019ve peaked, that you\u2019ll never get better. That\u2019s not reality. It\u2019s just your brain\u2019s way of protecting you from disappointment. Don\u2019t trust it.\n\n\\- Your network is your cheat code. The best jobs aren\u2019t on Indeed - they come from random conversations, LinkedIn messages, people remembering you exist. The more you put yourself out there, the more \"lucky breaks\" you'll get.\n\n\\- Confidence isn\u2019t a feeling, it\u2019s a strategy. I didn\u2019t feel confident when I told that company I wanted them. I acted confident. And guess what? It worked. People believe in you when you believe in yourself. Even if you\u2019re faking it.\n\nA few books that low-key saved my life during that time:\n\n\u00a0**-** [**The War of Art**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-war-of-art-by-steven-pressfield) **by Steven Pressfield**\n\nThis book will punch you in the face (in a good way). Pressfield talks about\u00a0Resistance - that invisible force that keeps you procrastinating, doubting yourself, and making excuses. Whether it\u2019s your career, fitness, or side hustle, this book will call you out and force you to level up. If you\u2019re stuck in analysis paralysis, read this ASAP. stop overthinking.\n\n**-** [**The Defining Decade**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-defining-decade-by-meg-jay) **by Meg Jay**\n\nEveryone in their 20s needs this. To me, even though I\u2019m in my 30s, this book also helped. It\u2019s about why your career, relationships, and habits matter way more than you think; and how to stop wasting time on the wrong things. No fluff, just real talk.\n\n**-** [**The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck-by-mark-manson) **by Mark Manson**\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck in self-pity and spiraling, this will snap you out of it. It\u2019s brutally honest, hilarious, and will make you rethink what actually matters in life. Such a game-changer.\n\n**-** [**So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-cal-newport) **by Cal Newport**\n\nThis killed my \u201cfollow your passion\u201d mindset. Instead, it teaches you how to build real career capital so opportunities chase *you*. Hands down the best career book I\u2019ve read. His other books are all pretty useful. Really good author.\n\n**- Mindset by Carol Dweck**\n\n\u00a0If you\u2019ve ever felt like you\u2019re \u201cjust not good enough,\u201d read this. It explains how success isn\u2019t about talent - it\u2019s about believing you can improve.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re in a rut, just know - you\u2019re not stuck forever. Even if it feels like it. Keep going. Try one more time. The opportunity you need might be the next one you trip over.",

They told me it takes at least a year to learn the job. Now this business is small and there are only 3 of us doing the same job. One that has been doing this type of work for 20+ years and has been here 8 years. The other one was hired and started with me but has been doing this type of work for years as well. \n\nThere are the 3 of us and the Manager in the back office and there are a lot of times that the 3 of them are all chatting about random stuff and I am ok not to be included in that as they do it throughout the day and I am in the office farthest away and I usually don't have much to say anyway.\n\nOther times they are talking about work stuff and I am never included in it. I know I am new and I don't know as much as the others, but I feel like if it has to do with our work, I should be involved. \n\nNow I am not one to just go join a conversation because I hear it going on. That is just not me. But I am trying to figure out a way to talk to the manager and tell her I am feeling left out without sounding like a whiney little child. \n\nI am really trying to learn things but my memory is not all that good after having some procedures done so I used to ask a lot of questions until it made sense and I could make notes that made sense.\n\nWell one day I was asking questions and the person answering was short and borderline hostile with me. So I quit asking questions especially after they said I am nowhere near where I should be for the time I have been here. \n\nThe manager said I was doing great for where I am and wondered why the other person said that. But she has not gotten back with me about that.\n\nI feel because I don't know as much as the others, I am just being left out of things and I feel so horrible about it. \n\nAs it is now, I come in, do my job and leave and don't get to really interact with the others other than saying hello and have a good night. I am not purposely ignoring them. I will try to join the conversations when I can, it just is happening when I am working and they all meet in the main room and I hear them all talking.\n\nAny advise?",

        "content": "Left out at work, losing my mind. help!\n\n30/F. I have lived in Italy for 5 years and worked in my current company for 2,5 years. On my first day in the office, I met with my colleagues however, they did not initiate any conversation except a cold \"welcome\". I had worked alone (my old position was not sociable) for 2 years and nothing changed. I was not invited to the lunch or breaks for smoking (I am a smoker also, they know that!) and instead, when I see that they are preparing to go, I ask them, \"oh, you are going for lunch/smoking? I am coming too!\" like a looser... Because I wanted to try, I did not want to isolate myself. I tried my best to open conversations, even on nonsense topics. Maybe I seemed awkward, I do not know... My manager acted better, but again, from a distance... He is closer with the team, tho.\n\nThen, my position was closed. My manager asked me if I would consider a new position. He also added that I am quiet and passive, but everyone deserves a chance. I answered yes, of course. With the new position, I would improve and collaborate with the team. However I just had 3-4 basic sessions of my new position, and when I asked questions to one of the colleagues, he told me \"how you do not know this? what will we do with you? i cannot believe!\", and when asked my manager how to do it, he explained with 2-3 sentences, as I know everything! My old position was a completely different and passive role!\n\nWhen I try to do something, I am judged as not knowing the business terms. How should I know?! It is also an entry-level position, and no one taught me anything- no shadowing, no mentoring, nothing! Also, one of my colleagues told me that no one teaches job; I have to learn myself (but how) I don't want to work because of this, I can't work anyway. I turn on the computer and mostly don't do anything, and no one says anything to me except for the meetings. I talk nonsense in performance meetings, I try to say something.\n\nI feel like a ghost. As I have lived abroad, my psychology is down. Now at my job, I still try to do something, but I am sure I seem and also I feel awkward, stupid, weird, and depressed. mentally disabled and socially awkward.\n\nSince I've started, 2-3 colleagues started after me, but they were accepted by the people. Because they make jokes, they are not sensitive or calm like me, but rather, confident, funny, and outgoing people.\n\nI should add that no one tells me what I am doing. I mean, if I do not do anything, it's also okay. But I do not feel comfortable because I am a responsible person. I am looking for a job to jump, but I cannot find one. I have some interviews tho, I have it will be alright anyway; otherwise, I will be crazy. I regret that I accepted the new position because I thought that it was because my old position was generally passive.\n\nAnd now, my manager acts careless, answers my questions with 1-2 words, that's all. I think he is disappointed because he was right.\n\nI asked myself if it was my mistake or not. I do not know. But I criticize myself too much.\n\nI should also add that I have fought with social phobia since my childhood. However, I overcame this situation by socializing, and I got better. I had also used fake it until make it technique too. This workplace seems to have destroyed all the social skills I had acquired and the social phobia I had fought. Now, I am lost, and I do not know what to do. :(\n",

It takes time to find references, do experiments, and maintain proper alignment. But when final content comes at the last moment and there are repeated changes, it creates confusion and delays.\n\nTeam Dynamics:\n\nOne team member has good aesthetic sense but sometimes adds random elements under pressure, which creates clashes.\n\nAnother team member is very functional, but this limits creative freedom. Sometimes they expect me to understand everything instantly, like an old-school teacher who doesn\u2019t want to repeat instructions.\n\n\nFuture & AI: I am a bit concerned about AI replacing even static designs soon, but I\u2019m not hopeless. I want to be careful and smart about my career direction.\n\nConclusion: I want to support the company\u2019s growth and I\u2019m ready to give my best.

        "content": "Perhaps the most ridiculous example of top-down bureaucratic education policy and the infantilizing of students is the belief that teachers shouldn't use red pens, as they allegedly \"convey unintentional negative emotions\".\nThere are countless sources for this absurd idea, but I'll share just one article below. If I shared the link directly it would get my post blocked, but a simple reverse Google search should bring up the source.\n\nHere's a crazy idea. Maybe students understand from years of experience that red pens are used to highlight their mistakes. So they associate the color red with people pointing out their mistakes. I imagine nobody particularly enjoys that, but it's very important all the same.\n\nYet in my own country of Belgium, you see these very same fads being introduced, as well as successful attempts to step away from grades in general, electing to replace them with smileys, color codes or any other mechanism that allows teachers and schools to obfuscate poor academic outcomes.\n\n>Sociologists Richard Dukes and Heather Albanesi of the University of Colorado claim in a paper they've had published in The Social Science Journal that when teachers use a red pen to add comments to student papers, students perceive them more negatively than if they use another color pen.\n\n>Red pens have traditionally been used by teachers when grading papers \u2013 ostensibly to make their comments and markings stand out from the original work \u2013 but this new research suggests that the use of a red pen may convey unintentional negative emotions.\n\n>To find out if markings in red had any measureable impact on students, the two researchers enlisted the assistance of 199 undergraduate students \u2013 each was given four versions of an already graded essay by an unknown instructor. The graded remarks were deemed as high or low in quality with some written in red, others in blue. The students were asked to read the essay and the remarks given by the instructor and then to rate how they felt about what the instructor had written and to suggest what grade they would have given the essay. They were also asked how they felt about the instructor that had written the original remarks. After they'd finished with their opinions, each was also given a questionnaire designed to provide the researchers with more concrete data.\n\n>In analyzing their results, the researchers found that the student volunteers didn't seem to be impacted one way or another by pen color when they agreed with the instructor's comments and grade. But when they disagreed, there were definitely some differences \u2013 mainly negative. When the instructors' comments were written in red versus blue the volunteers judged them more harshly and as a result, rated them lower in \"bedside manner.\" Overall, they say, the volunteers didn't seem to judge the quality of the comments any differently \u2013 their negative feelings were aimed at the person that had written the remarks when they wrote in red ink.\n\n>Dukes and Heather theorize that red ink is akin to using all caps when writing e-mail or text messages \u2013 it's like shouting at a person and those on the other end quite naturally feel a little bit abused and respond by growing angry or sad, which, they note, doesn't really promote the learning process. They suggest instructors stop using red pens and go with a shade of blue instead.",

Private schools would end up accepting vouchers to compensate the tuition?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a voucher system taking over the entire country, but if the DoEd is gutted, and special education funds were not allocated or services protected through the IDEA- would it really just fall on states to determine how these services are paid and played out? Would public schools basically just become special education facilities? ",

A lot of people select schools for emotional or religious reasons. Private schools can be selective and exclude who they don't want. Using a restaurant analogy, such a system would range from fast food quality all the way to Michelin star quality. High-end restaurants exclude poor people based on price. Most private schools would be mid-level.\n\n Poor and minority students would still be subject to factors such as the availability of transportation to a given school, cost of extracurricular activities, etc. Many private schools also expect contributions of time and money from parents, so that might exclude poor students whose parents can't afford to take time off from work to volunteer at the school.\n\nhttps://www.nola.com/news/education/louisiana-school-vouchers-academic-results-la-gator/article_06eaec14-e8a2-11ef-82b9-d75d434eaa34.html",

Remember, we didn't even have compulsory education past grade school that long ago - my grandfather dropped out at 11 to sharecrop so his family could survive, and that was totally legal then. In fact, it was *unusual* that my grandmother completed secondary school - albeit in a one-room, all-ages schoolhouse with her own father doing most of the teaching.\n\nThere were a lot of Black people in the same county they grew up in. Exactly *none* of their children were attending school in the 1920s and 1930s. If they received any schooling, it was at Sunday School or at segregated public schools that gave them only the basics.\n\nIn the 1950s, same state (Arkansas), Black children were spit on, called foul names, attacked and had to go to the Federal government to gain entry to a decent education.\n\nThat was where this pushback began, almost immediately. How dare the Feds insist that Black and brown people be educated (because whites believed them to be inferior - and also secretly feared what would happen if they thrived and succeeded...)?? \n\nAnd then the Federal government had to get involved to make sure disabled children could go to school too. That fight didn't even *begin* until the 1970s, when I was at school. And as the parent and grandparents of kids with disabilities, I can tell you that fight hasn't been won yet.\n\nNeither has the other one. For a brief shining moment, some places started to desegregate their schools. I was there, and it was great. But the resurgent \"Christian\" right - resurgent in no small part specifically because of what they did next - jumped in with so-called \"seg academies\" (segregated Chrustian private schools) and demands for vouchers to pay for them.\n\nAnd here we are.",

The department is also ending leases on buildings in cities such as New York, Boston, and Chicago.\n* Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that the department will continue to deliver all statutory programs, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, and funding for special needs students, despite staff cuts.[U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force)\n* The Department, which handles $1.6T in federal student loans and enforces civil rights for students with disabilities, provides less than 10% of the US's public school funding. Most education funding comes from state and local taxes.\n* Its Office of Civil Rights faced particularly steep cuts, with regional centers being shuttered or reduced to minimal staffing in New York, San Francisco, and Boston, raising concerns about its ability to process civil rights probes.\n* The announcement prompted the temporary closure of all department offices in Washington, DC, as well as regional offices for security reasons, with employees instructed to take their laptops home and leave their office buildings by 6 pm.\n\n# Republican narrative\n\nTrump's education reforms, including Department of Education layoffs and reduced overhead for research grants, represent essential market corrections to an inefficient system. Removing bureaucratic bloat and redirecting funds to states promises to improve student outcomes while addressing higher education's declining productivity and escalating costs.\n\n# Democratic narrative\n\nGutting the Education Department threatens America's foundational promise of equal opportunity. By slashing its workforce and canceling programs that help disadvantaged students, disabled children, and aspiring college graduates, Trump's administration risks dismantling vital safeguards that level the educational playing field\u2014potentially widening inequality and undermining America's global competitiveness.\n\n# Sources\n\n[U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force)\n\n[Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/education-department-donald-trump-usaid/2025/03/11/id/1202393/)\n\n[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/us-education-department-layoffs)\n\n[CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/department-of-education-job-cuts/)\n\n[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html)\n\n[Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/education-dept-staff-expected-to-be-slashed-by-half-as-trump-mulls-closing-it)",

But none of that is in the news, as it the problems of those doing the work, the factotums, vs federal employees, who apparently are more important to the media, though they do very little.\n\nWhat do I care if a bunch of bureaucrats are laid off?  It won't impact my teaching.  What is all this hysteria about?\nThe department of education hasn't done much, except insist on crappy common core standards that they spent a fortune to develop.\nI don't like Trump, but I support the Republicans narrative a lot more than the Democrats narrative.\n\nEdit :\nto all you down voters, you must have tenure or not work in teaching.\ni know of plenty of teachers working on temporary contracts, or going from school to school on probationary contracts.  This is a huge issue and never covered by the media.  It affects the quality of instruction vastly more than the Dep of Ed.  The people who actually do the work are getting screwed, and have been getting screwed since 2009, but no outrage.  Only for federal employees that do very little.\nBrainwashed.",

However, the results did not show how I expected them to, you could easily tell which kids worked hard and contributed to the lessons and which kids just sat and didn\u2019t bother to engage at all. Still I continued to try uplift them by leaving positive feedback like \u201cI know that this essay may not have gone the way you expected it to but I am really proud of you for trying and it will get better with more practice\u201d.\n\nLast week I started to feel unwell (not sick but I just was under the weather) and on top of that i saw my students were very nervous about the test that they were going to write (they wrote it today). So I worked very slowly with them on the work and gave them an activity similar to the test and had them do it in class so that if they needed help, I could help.

I didn\u2019t teach in full force to avoid any more stress from the kids asking \u201cis this in the test\u201d when I posted a scope and also told them what to study.\n\nPlease note, I create engaging classes where I am always looking for ways to get them up and talking to me but 97% of the students just refuse to and it causes me to have to just talk the whole lesson which I don\u2019t like doing but I can\u2019t waste time trying to get an answer for it simply to be \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday I was sitting by my desk talking to them about the work and just trying to have a relaxed environment to have them talk because I felt that maybe because I was always standing, they felt uncomfortable (I was desperate to find ways to get them to engage). \n\nOn Tuesday my boss came to sit in my class (wasn\u2019t expecting it but it isn\u2019t wrong) and after the lesson they asked to speak to me. They first were very hostile towards me where they said do I always teach like this and how boring my lesson was, I tried to explain but they said that a concerning amount of students had come to complain about my class being boring and how they didn\u2019t want to take my subject anymore. I felt completely uncomfortable because I had never had this come to my attention (despite me always asking my students to tell me if they need me to approach topics differently) and I felt like I was being called a bad teacher. The boss said that if those amounts of my students were to leave, they\u2019d have no reason to keep me. I teach 5 other classes who are always engaged with me and we have so much fun so I feel hurt that because of one class, I am now being seen like I did everything wrong. \n\nI always post on our school educational portal extra resources to have them look through and I ask them to have a look at one or two of these resources before they see me so we can have a fun discussion but 3% only do this and I try my best to do as much as I can but they resist my attempts.\n\nI am hurt and I am so uncomfortable about this situation, I know that in order to grow you must be ready to face uncomfortable feelings but I just really feel like I am not being heard from my authority figures. I sent an email afterwards (a day after to just properly think) and I haven\u2019t gotten a response however they have responded to other messages I\u2019ve been CC\u2019d in and it really makes me nervous about this situation.\n\nDoes anyone have advice to help me navigate this situation? I am so worried about this whole thing that it actually made me sick that I couldn\u2019t go to work today and have been booked off until Monday but I\u2019m going back tomorrow because I have to hand in tests before the classes write. \n",

They offer easy explanations for why you're poor and your kid is suffering - that it's because those immigrants your state just accepted are asking for benefits that YOU PAID FOR. You - the one who's struggling with basic needs. The human mind isn't made in a way that makes it easy or straightforward to recognize when we're being manipulated by the people who we're supposed to trust.\n\nThe advent of Russian and Chinese troll farms just adds fuel to that fire. The Biden administration failed to prioritize the issue of election interference via social media by Russia over the war in Ukraine. \n\nThen there are conservatives who are rightly worried about our economy. Not about unemployment, but about the GDP:National Debt ratio. There are historical precedents of countries' economic falls from greatness when that ratio is above 1, and ours is around 1.23. [Check out this trend.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp#:~:text=In%20the%20long%2Dterm%2C%20the,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.)\n\nBill Clinton was very successful at reducing this ratio, but he was forced to work with a conservative House and Senate, which many see as the real reason it was reduced on his watch. \n\nThe conservatives who voted for Trump because of the economy aren't very happy right now. Just today they were wriggling on r/conservative about how bad the tariffs are going to be for the economy, and they've been equally upset about the new budget bill. I agree that they should have seen this coming, but I also understand why they voted in a Republican even if Trump wasn't necessarily the candidate they wanted to vote for.

Unfortunately, hate speech is protected by the first amendment, so even if Columbia University promoted hate speech, it's still protected.\n\nSecondly, Columbia University did not promote hate speech. Please find me the example of the school administration, or any official documentation promoting hate speech. You can't and you won't because you use feelings to make your arguments, not reality. \n\nThe University has bad apples and they can choose to expell those students if they wish, but they would need proof, not just hearsay, but the federal government stepping in and cutting funding for research (done by students who probably had nothing to do with the alleged hate speech), despite contracts and despite lack of evidence, and despite the question of free speech, is absurd, almost certainly illegal and a massive government overreach. \n\nNext, you'll be justifying throwing protestors in jail, \"yea they have the freedom to protest but only behind bars!\"",

        "content": "Navigating Medical Claim Denials: How Denial Management Services Can Help\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hbvzzxdlnoe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2d0c006d3e5c7784dd599d408af754daa04f60b\n\nNavigating the American healthcare system can feel like traversing a minefield, especially when you\u2019re already vulnerable and seeking treatment. One of the most frustrating and disheartening experiences is dealing with medical claim denials. When a legitimate claim is denied by an insurance company, patients are often left feeling confused and financially burdened. Why does this happen, and what can be done about it?\n\nThe reality is that while insurance companies play a role in managing healthcare costs, the system is fraught with complexities, profit-driven decisions, and bureaucratic hurdles that lead to frequent denials. Medical billing services and medical coding solutions can help mitigate these challenges and ensure proper reimbursement. Let\u2019s explore the key reasons behind medical claim denials and how a reliable medical billing company can help.\n\n# 1. Profit-Driven Decision Making\n\nInsurance companies are businesses aiming to maximize profits. Their stringent claim approval criteria often result in unnecessary denials, leaving patients and providers struggling to secure rightful reimbursements.\n\n* **Algorithms and Automated Systems:**\u00a0Many insurers use automated review systems that may rigidly deny claims based on preset criteria, even when the treatment is medically necessary.\n* **Prior Authorization Hurdles:**\u00a0Prior authorization requirements often create roadblocks when insurers impose guidelines that don\u2019t align with updated medical evidence.\n* **Downcoding and Denials:**\u00a0Insurance companies may downcode claims \u2014 assigning a lower-level code than what was performed \u2014 to minimize payouts, leading to financial losses for providers and patients.\n\n# 2. Complexity and Bureaucracy\n\nThe healthcare system is layered with regulations, codes, and documentation requirements that create opportunities for errors and claim denials.\n\n* **Coding Errors:**\u00a0Medical coding solutions are essential in preventing human errors that can trigger claim rejections. Even minor discrepancies in coding can lead to denials.\n* **Documentation Issues:**\u00a0Insurance companies demand comprehensive documentation to support claims. Missing or incomplete documentation can lead to claim denials, even when the treatment was medically necessary.\n* **Lack of Transparency:**\u00a0Patients and providers often struggle to understand why claims are denied, making it difficult to appeal successfully.\n\n# 3. The Human Factor in Claim Denials\n\nDespite automation, human bias and operational inefficiencies also contribute to claim denials.\n\n* **Insufficient Staffing and Training:**\u00a0Undertrained claims reviewers may rush through claims, increasing the chances of wrongful denials.\n* **Subjective Interpretations:**\u00a0Different claims reviewers may interpret medical necessity guidelines differently, leading to inconsistencies in approvals.\n* **Bias and Discrimination:**\u00a0Implicit biases can sometimes influence claim denials, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.\n\n# 4. The Patient\u2019s Role in Managing Claims\n\nWhile insurance companies bear responsibility for denials, patients can take proactive steps to improve claim outcomes.\n\n* **Understanding Insurance Coverage:**\u00a0Many patients are unaware of their policy limitations, leading to unexpected denials.\n* **Appealing Denied Claims:**\u00a0Patients often forgo appealing denials, assuming they have no recourse. Knowing the appeals process is essential.\n* **Effective Communication:**\u00a0Clear communication between patients, healthcare providers, and insurers can prevent misunderstandings that lead to claim denials.\n\n# How Allzone Medical Billing Can Help\n\nIn this complex and frustrating landscape,\u00a0Allzone Medical Billing\u00a0offers expert\u00a0denial management services\u00a0to help medical practices secure rightful reimbursements. As a trusted\u00a0medical billing company, we ensure accuracy, transparency, and advocacy in claim processing.\n\n**Human-Centric Precision**\n\nUnlike firms that rely solely on automated systems,\u00a0Allzone Medical Billing\u00a0prioritizes human expertise. Our team of certified specialists deeply understands\u00a0medical billing services, coding guidelines, and insurance policies. This knowledge helps us rectify errors before they lead to denials.\n\n**Transparency and Advocacy**\n\nWe operate with complete transparency, providing clear explanations of claim statuses. Our team fights tirelessly to appeal denied claims and recover the reimbursements our clients deserve.\n\n**Proactive Prevention**\n\nRather than reacting to claim denials,\u00a0Allzone\u00a0focuses on prevention through accurate coding, thorough documentation, and meticulous claim preparation. Continuous education and training ensure our team stays ahead of industry changes.\n\nSpecialized Expertise\n\nWe offer\u00a0medical coding solutions\u00a0tailored to various specialties, ensuring increased claim acceptance rates. Our expertise spans multiple medical fields, helping providers navigate the complexities of billing and reimbursement.\n\n# What Can You Do?\n\nWhile the system has flaws, you can take steps to improve your chances of claim approval:\n\n* Review your insurance policy to understand coverage limitations.\n* Ensure that documentation and coding are accurate.\n* Appeal denied claims instead of accepting them as final.\n* Work with a professional\u00a0medical billing company\u00a0like\u00a0Allzone\u00a0to handle billing and denial management efficiently.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe fight for fair healthcare access is ongoing. By understanding the causes of\u00a0medical claim denials\u00a0and partnering with experts in\u00a0denial management services, patients and providers can navigate the system more effectively.\u00a0Allzone Medical Billing\u00a0stands as a reliable partner in this journey, ensuring that legitimate claims are processed accurately and paid promptly.

I've applied three cycles and have been rejected each time, so it is time to move on with life and go a different route. I have 5 years of experience as a veterinary technician, but the pay, work life balance, and the toll on my body is becoming too much. My opportunities for growth within the field have reached a roadblock as well, so I am stuck. I'd love to stay in the healthcare field, but I'm not interested in clinical work with humans (nursing, med school, etc). I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management and I am interested in pursuing a Masters' to gain more skills and open up more doors for careers. I have leadership experience within the veterinary industry on my resume as well. The MHA seems like a very interesting program and provides career opportunities I'm very interested in, and the average salary is attractive. I've done a lot of my own research but would love to hear first-hand from those who have completed the program/actively work in the field. \n\nFor those who have changed career paths and gotten an MHA, did you think it was beneficial? Was it \"easy\" for you to find job opportunities upon completing? Was the salary/cost of tuition payoff worth it? Do you enjoy your day-to-day? Also, if I decide to do this program (it will be online so I can work), are there any jobs/positions you recommend I work in to gain hands-on experience while in school? \n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\n",

Like others have mentioned, I strongly encourage pursuing a fellowship\u2014it provides invaluable hands-on experience and a strong foundation for advancing in healthcare leadership. It also can start your career with an organization as most fellows go on to be employed by the organization. \n\nBefore earning my MHA, I spent ten years working in healthcare, but this degree truly elevated my understanding of the industry, from market dynamics and operations to leadership and strategic management. It accelerated my career trajectory, enabling me to advance more quickly into leadership roles.\n\nFor those considering an MHA, gaining direct experience in healthcare is an excellent first step. Look for entry-level roles in registration, patient scheduling, billing, coding, or hospital supply chain\u2014these positions will give you exposure to the operational side of healthcare. Once you\u2019re in the field, focus on building a reputation as a hardworking, reliable, and solution-oriented professional. As you progress through your degree, new opportunities will emerge, and you\u2019ll be well-positioned to take advantage of them.",

So between ordering and dispense, the PBM told the pharmacy that they could only dispense 15. \n\nWhen the pharmacists reviews the filled prescription with the patient at pick up, that would have been the time to bring up the dispense question. \"My doctor ordered 30, why is there only 15?\". The answer was likely \"your benefits only cover the 15.\". Then the question goes back on the patient to follow up with the provider to get a prior authorization for the full amount, pay out of pocket for the remaining 15, or get the 15 for their copay and refill once they are done the 15 for another copay. \n\n(Again, I'm not saying this is right, this is just how it is)",

My partner (not married but we live together) does not have insurance since she is self employed and missed a few payments. \n\nI tried to apply for benefits and add her to my plan so we could both be covered. However, we needed a joint bank account as part of the proof of domestic partnership for me to add her and I have the credit score of a victorian ghost boy, so I've been having a har time getting us a joint account. \n\nIn addition to all of this, I am planning to leave my current job soon in order to start my own business. We were hoping that me changing employment while both of us were covered would be a qualifying event to purchase a plan outside of open enrollment. \n\nMy question is, if I were to get insurance for myself while still employed here, then leave, would that count as a qualifying event and would I then be able to add her to my new plan once leaving this job? \n\nThanks in advance and fuck the US Healthcare system!",

I called the drs office and asked for a cost break down and they said they would send it but never did no matter how many times I called. \n\nLast Friday which was 3 business days before the surgery they told me the amount and said I had to pay in full. Fine. I am using CareCredit and I called to ask how to pay using them. They didn\u2019t know and told me I had to pay in full and it is what it is. They told me they can\u2019t take the amount over the phone starting last month and it sometimes takes a week or two for the payment to be received but I had to pay up front. I finally went through CareCredit directly and found the location and add my details and the invoice number last Friday.\n\nI called this Monday to care credit and confirmed the payment was sent and asked for a confirmation number or something to give the hospital. I got an authorization number. I called back the hospital and was transferred so many times. No one can help me at all. I was hung up on many times. I am so pissed right now. I finally get to someone and they say I can\u2019t see the amount right now but I will transfer you to pre surgery to see if they have it. The lady said we don\u2019t even handle seeing if money is receive we only see when the amount is paid. \n\nI\u2019m so done with life right now. I have already set up FMLA with my job gotten time off approved. I got the food I would need to heal. I\u2019ve made all these plans and might not have the surgery.

It's super stressful to deal with payment and communication issues at a time like this \ud83d\ude15.\n\n\n\nFirst off, make sure you keep track of all your calls and interactions with CareCredit and the hospital. Write down who you spoke to, when you talked, and what was said. This could really help if you need to push harder on this.\n\n\n\nSince you have an authorization number from CareCredit, hold onto that as proof that you started the payment process. Maybe see if CareCredit can give you any more proof that you've paid \ud83d\udcc4.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like you've been bounced around a lot on the phone. Try to get in touch directly with the hospital\u2019s billing department or a patient advocate. They usually have more power to fix stuff like this.\n\n\n\nIf you keep hitting walls, don't be shy about asking to speak with a supervisor or sending a formal complaint that lays out all the problems you've had and asks for immediate help \ud83d\udea8.\n\n\n\nIf it looks like this payment issue could delay your surgery and you think the hospital is dropping the ball, it might be worth it to talk to a lawyer who knows about consumer rights \u2696\ufe0f.\n\n\n\nYou could also ask the hospital if they can let you use another way to pay for now, like a credit card, just to make sure your surgery doesn\u2019t get postponed. They could always give you a refund once the CareCredit payment goes through \ud83d\udcb3.\n\n\n\nIt sucks that you have to deal with this now, but keeping on top of them and documenting everything will really help.

They did blood pressure, weight, had blood work taken, discussed results. \n\nSince it was my first wellness visit with him, I brought a result of a scan I had on my liver a couple of  years ago. It had to do with my higher liver AST result. \n\nI received a bill that I was charged for nutritional office visit along with my wellness visit. I called the insurance company and the doctors office and both of them claim that during a wellness visit if you need to discuss anything, even if it pertains to your blood results, you have to come in for a separate visit.  Since we discussed it at my visit, I was charged.\n\nI\u2019m 52 years old I\u2019ve always discussed my health at my wellness visit and I have never been charged. I understand that they do not want people coming in and holding the doctor up for a long time, but I can\u2019t agree with charging me for a visit or discussing something that took possibly two minutes and it pertained to my blood results. \n\nSo is this something that\u2019s common practice and has just never happened to me in the past or is this a newer issue.

        "content": "Through the Lens of COVID: A Radiologic Technologist\u2019s Story\nI\u2019ve been an X-Ray and CT Technologist for almost ten years, and I\u2019ve always taken pride in my work. But nothing could have prepared me\u2014or any of us\u2014for what the COVID-19 pandemic brought. It wasn\u2019t just the virus itself; it was the way it exposed the cracks in our healthcare system, the way it pushed us all to our limits, and the way it changed how we saw our work, our patients, and each other. I want to share some of my story, not just as a technologist, but as someone who stood alongside my colleagues in the trenches, trying to keep up with an endless wave of patients (both COVID and non-COVID) who needed us more than ever.\n\n**The Early Days: Fear and Uncertainty**\n\nWhen COVID first hit, everything changed overnight. The hospital felt like a war zone. Patients were pouring in, and we were scrambling to keep up. I remember the first time I scanned a COVID patient\u2014my hands were shaking as I adjusted the machine, trying to focus on the image while my mind raced with questions. What if I got sick? What if I brought it home to my family? But there was no time to dwell on those fears. The patients needed us, and we had to be there for them.\n\nThe images I saw during those early months still haunt me. Lungs that should have been clear and healthy were filled with the telltale \u201cground-glass opacities\u201d of COVID pneumonia. It was unique, it was unusual, and it attacked everywhere in the body. It was devastating to see how quickly the virus could take hold, especially in patients who seemed healthy just days before. And the hardest part was knowing that many of them were alone, isolated from their families, relying on us not just for medical care, but for comfort and reassurance.\n\n**The Struggle to Keep Up**\n\nAs the pandemic dragged on, the sheer volume of patients became overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t just COVID cases\u2014it was everything. People who had put off routine care during the early months of the pandemic were now coming in with advanced illnesses. Heart attacks, strokes, cancers that had gone undetected for too long. The waiting rooms were packed, the schedules were overbooked, and we were all running on fumes.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the look on my colleagues\u2019 faces as we tried to keep up. Nurses, doctors, fellow technologists\u2014we were all exhausted, physically and emotionally. I saw people breaking down in the break room, crying from the stress of it all. I saw coworkers working double shifts, skipping meals, and sacrificing their own health to be there for their patients. And I saw some of the best, most dedicated professionals I\u2019ve ever known leave the field altogether because they just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Losing them was like losing a piece of our team\u2019s soul. These people were irreplaceable, their wisdom, their dedication\u2026 we needed them, and the system failed them. The communities are worse off without them. \n\n**The Human Side of It All**\n\nWhat sticks with me the most, though, are the people\u2014the patients and the families. I remember one elderly man who came in for a CT scan. He was so scared, and all he wanted was to hold his wife\u2019s hand. But she wasn\u2019t allowed in the room because of visitor restrictions. So I held his hand instead, trying to reassure him as I positioned him for the scan. He thanked me afterward, and I had to fight back tears because I knew it wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t the same as having his family there. How could it? And many fellow professionals were too busy and exhausted to provide the level of comfort these people needed.. we were stretched way further than the usual. \n\nAnd then there were the families themselves, waiting anxiously for news. I\u2019d see them in the hallways, their faces masked but their fear unmistakable. Sometimes, I\u2019d overhear them talking to doctors, trying to understand what was happening to their loved ones. Other times, I\u2019d see them saying goodbye over video calls, unable to be there in person. Those moments broke my heart in a way I can\u2019t even put into words.\n\n**A System Under Strain**\n\nThe pandemic didn\u2019t just test us as individuals\u2014it tested the entire healthcare system. And in so many ways, the system failed. We didn\u2019t have enough staff, enough equipment, or enough time to give every patient the care they deserved. I saw people waiting hours, even days, for scans that should have been done immediately. I saw patients with treatable conditions getting worse because they couldn\u2019t access care in time. And I saw my colleagues\u2014good, caring people\u2014burn out and walk away because they couldn\u2019t keep fighting a system that felt like it was working against them.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel angry about it. We\u2019re supposed to be a safety net, a place where people can turn when they\u2019re sick or scared. But the pandemic showed just how fragile that net really is. And now, as we try to pick up the pieces, I worry about what happens next. Will we learn from this? Will we invest in our healthcare system, in our workers, in our patients? Or will we go back to the way things were, pretending everything\u2019s fine until the next crisis hits?\n\n**A Call for Change**\n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers, but I know this: we can\u2019t keep going like this. We need more support for healthcare workers\u2014better pay, better staffing, better mental health resources. We need to prioritize access to care for everyone, not just those who can afford it. And we need to remember the lessons of this pandemic, not just the pain and the loss, but the resilience and the humanity that got us through it. Patient volumes have only gotten worse since COVID pandemic, and data trends suggest we will continue to exponentially increase in people needing care, peaking in 2040.  \n\nTo my fellow healthcare workers: thank you. Thank you for showing up, even when it felt impossible. Thank you for caring, even when it hurt. And to everyone else: please don\u2019t forget what we\u2019ve been through. Advocate for change. Support your local hospitals and clinics. And remember that behind every mask, every scan, every diagnosis, there\u2019s a person\u2014a patient, a family, a healthcare worker\u2014just trying to make it through.\n\nThis is my story, but it\u2019s also the story of so many others. I share it not for sympathy, but in the hope that it will inspire action. Because if we don\u2019t learn from this, if we don\u2019t do better, then what was it all for?\n",

While some companies sell travel policies for individuals visiting the US, they typically exclude pre-existing conditions.  If they do have any coverage, it will be limited to acute onset of a pre-existing condition, meaning the condition was controlled but it unexpectedly flared up.  For example, an individual with well controlled asthma having an unexpected asthma attack while in the US.  \n\nI would recommend calling Boston Children's Hodpital's Global Care office and asking about financial assistance.  Their Global Care office can help coordinate with your country's embassy, charitable organizations, and Boston Children's financial services department.  They will have far more resources to identify available funds than what you'll find searching on your own.  \n\nhttps://answers.childrenshospital.org/global-international-patient-services/#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20more%20than%202%2C500,supported%20both%20culturally%20and%20linguistically.%E2%80%9D\n\nhttps://www.childrenshospital.org/international/contact-us",

I had a previous background in engineering, which impacted my GPA. Now, I\u2019m focused on increasing my chances for next year by gaining 500\\* hours of direct patient care by February 2026.\n\nMy plan is to get this experience through either phlebotomy or CNA work. I\u2019m looking for recommendations for schools in Southern California, preferably in the Inland Empire (around Temecula) or Los Angeles (near Long Beach). I\u2019m willing to spend up to $2,000 if the program is accelerated.\n\nIf anyone has advice on schools or tips for getting 500\\* hours of paid direct patient care in an acute hospital setting by February 2026, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it! I'm feeling a little bummed out right now, but I\u2019m determined to make this happen.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Quest Diagnostics bill back to haunt me after I thought it had already been paid and taken care of\nBuckle in. This is more of a rant than a question, but if anyone has advice for my situation, feel free to comment with it. \n\nFor starters, I'm a trans male who possesses a uterus, and I require preventatives such as pap smears. Had my first ever pap smear in May 2022. No problems. Heard nothing about it as far as billing goes. I had Virginia Medicaid, so I just assumed it had been fully covered since it was a preventative.\n\nFast forward to February of 2023, I have a bill from Quest Diagnostics because Virginia Medicaid didn't cover the pathology for the pap. I call Virginia Medicaid. I get told that their system was automatically refusing to cover the claim because my sex marker was male. I go through the trouble and pain of contacting Social Services to have my sex marker with them reverted *back* to female so that Medicaid will cover it, which I frankly shouldn't have to do. The bill, from what I can tell, gets covered. I run into 0 billing issues for the next year. I even move to Massachusetts, change health insurance, and have lab work done through Quest up until February 2024. The bill from the pap was no longer active in my Quest account, and I know this because I was paying other bills for the other lab work I was receiving.\n\nI move back to Virginia in late 2024. Re-enroll in Virginia Medicaid (which has changed companies at least 3 times in the past couple of years, and now seems to primarily be handled by Sentara Health Plans) because I'm job hunting and interviewing and lack employer insurance. \n\nI log into Quest today, in 2025, and look at my bills out of pure curiosity. The bill for the pap is back, seemingly unpaid! And it says it's now been sent to collections.\n\nI contact Quest. They have the completely incorrect info for the bill \u2014 name and address are all previous ones, which I don't think were even being *used* at the time (I legally changed my name in early 2022, for reference). It's now showing the old name for several bills in Quest too up until I moved to Massachusetts, and I have no idea why.\n\nQuest says to contact Sentara Health. I call them, explain the situation, tell them that I thought this had been resolved already and that I shouldn't have to revert my sex marker with them to female *again* because their system can't work this stuff out. My birth certificate has also been updated to indicate I am male and so have all my other documents, so I'm not even sure I could technically prove a female birth sex to Social Services again at this point. The person I spoke to was very kind and considerate, said they were going to have to appeal the claim since it's been sent to collections, and they instructed me to contact the provider who ordered the pap, tell them to submit a reconsideration claim, and give them the appeals number that Sentara Health has assigned to the case.\n\nI called my old provider's office about it. The person who answered the phone said they would contact Quest about it since it was the pathology with them and the actual visit was covered under my insurance. I provided this person with all the context, told them about the reconsideration claim, and gave them the appeals number. I don't know what else to do now except wait, which kills me. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake listing myself as male when I submitted my application for Virginia Medicaid upon returning to Virginia, but I did not want to be gendered incorrectly by insurance because of the reproductive organs I have. \n\nGiven that this bill appeared to have been covered after I dealt with this headache back in 2023, I'm wondering if it has been retroactively *unpaid* by my insurance because I listed my sex marker as male when I re-enrolled with them. I didn't even know that was possible, but I was told by the person at my doctor that it is, and that's truly insane to me.\n\nPart of me is tempted to pay the bill so I don't risk getting sued in the future. I have received no contact from a collections agency, and I have no idea how long this bill has been with collections. But I am going to wait and see what happens with this process that Sentara Health has instructed me to follow first.",

        "content": "Seeking guidance regarding workplace situation and treatment\nI started as a nurse resident and was hired alongside another RN who had three years of experience as an LPN in a psych clinic was a supervisor there. This person became supervisor a few months after being hired and little after this I began feeling harassed by her. What concerns me the most is that she has the authority to write my six-month evaluation, and given my experiences with her, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. \n\nFirst thing that happened was that I had been feeling harassed by her. Then one time in december I was sick and left home early. I made a mistake of attaching the feeding pump to the wrong hole and this leaked into the bed. I was told by another person that she talked badly of me in front my patient. Which is very, very unprofessional. \n\nRecently, I was able to work opposite schedules from her, and those four weeks were the most stress-free I\u2019ve had. However, when I finally had a shift with her again, drama ensued.\n\nLast week I had a patient with borderline hypotension (SBP 86). I believed that the drop was positional due to the patient being in reverse Trendelenburg to perform a straight cath. The tech took the BP while the patient was still in this position, and explained the family that the it was likely positional. Patient was asymptomatic and there were no changes from baseline. I placed patient Trendelenburg, wanted to wait how she responded, and then messaged the provider. The tech called the assistant manager and I dont know what she told her, but defenitely expressed a concern regarding me and patient safety. \n\nThe night assistant manager was hovering the whole time, her usual self, call a nonemergent rapid, and even lied while giving a report to the morning assistant manager, falsely claiming the patient\u2019s SBP was in the 60s. When the morning assistant manager reviewed the chart, they found no record of a BP in the 60s (she likely thought that she was being dramatic) and even agreed with my thoughts on the situation: the tech should have informed me and for her to stay in her lane. Additionally, the BP was not concerning enough to warrant a non emergent rapid. She said that it could have managed by us. I felt like the night supervisor was not letting advocate for my patient, I felt like she was micromanaging the whole situation. \n\nThat morning the patient had a rapid due to minimal responsiveness and they narcan her. I asked for a reversal of anesthesia and they told me to let her sleep it off. \n\nThe tech has been on the floor for a couple of years. So I dont expect nothing to be done with her as she is the favorite of the manager. I just need to communicate things that are outside of her scope in other for her to not escalate things. Regarding the asistant manager, leadership protects leadership. I dont expect nothing to be done in this regard. \n\nAt this point, my biggest concern is ensuring she does not have the power to write my six-month evaluation. Given her behavior, I don\u2019t believe she can be impartial. There are 3 night supervisors. What suggestions do you have for me? \n\nThis situation paired with her talking poorly  in front of one of my patiens  i",

In the 2 months preceding payment I received an average of 0.4 robocalls daily, peaking at 4. Since paying the bill, I have had 2.4 robocalls daily, peaking at 14, which was the day after paying the bill. The majority of them are about health insurance. It seems pretty obvious that the two are related.\n\nSo is this just a fact of life now? Did the healthcare provider do something wrong or is all US healthcare like this? I'd switch providers, but I'm curious as to whether this is the new normal.",

(I understand the risks) self pay prices are usually so much cheaper.\nThere\u2019s also health shares, which seem to be gaining popularity. \nI\u2019m no expert in any aspect of healthcare so I\u2019d love to hear what people think?\n",

And it\u2019s scary as hell but true\u2014nearly every person is one medical emergency away from bankruptcy. Insurance mitigates that. \n\nNo one expects to get cancer or break their leg and need an emergency surgery. But even a high deductible plan can help mitigate the cost of that. It also puts a maximum out-of-pocket on your healthcare spending (there are caveats with uncovered care but generally, it gives you a stopgap), which isn\u2019t available if you\u2019re uninsured. It also provides avenues for contracted rates, which aren\u2019t guaranteed if you are self-pay. \n\nRegarding the health sharing plans, skip them. They\u2019re bad news. John Oliver has a special on it, or I know many folks have discussed it in this group before. \n\nMy suggestion, if you\u2019re generally healthy, would be to get the cheapest marketplace plan available. If it\u2019s an HMO, specifically, make sure you follow their referral guidelines if you need to see anyone other than your assigned PCP. Then you will have some form of coverage if something bad happens (and several forms of preventative care will be covered) but you aren\u2019t paying a top-tier rate for insurance you may not use very frequently.",

But they do. \n\nI'm Joe Truax, leader of the #2 'Wholesome and Heartwarming' subreddit r/GuyCry, and my goals are always to keep people informed.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of what's going on. The following was written by Ryan DeGooyer:\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t figure out why there wasn\u2019t even more outrage about impending Medicaid cuts.. then saw a lady on tv state she wasn\u2019t concerned because she\u2019s on medi-cal\u2026 and I realized\u2026 some people don\u2019t even know THEIR benefits are being cut because states often rename Medicaid (we all see where this is going right?). \n\nMedicaid is a joint federal-state program designed to provide healthcare coverage to disabled children and adults. Almost one million senior citizens in nursing homes rely on Medicaid.\n\n**EDIT BY ME, OP: Medicaid is for more than just disabled children and adults. Its for low income ANYONE that meets certain prerequisites.**\n\nThe funding structure involves both federal and state contributions, with the federal share determined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). \n\nThis percentage varies based on a state's per capita income, ranging from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 83%. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government covered approximately 69.8% of total Medicaid costs, with states contributing the remaining 30.2%. \nPEWTRUSTS.ORG \n\nStop saying \"the state pays medicaid!\" because the state only pays 30-50%. Its FEDERAL money that the states distribute. \n\nSo, If you or your loved ones are covered by any of the following\u2026 they are talking about you:\n\nAlabama: Medicaid  \nAlaska : DenaliCare  \nArizona: Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS)  \nArkansas: Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME)  \nCalifornia: Medi-Cal  \nColorado: Health First Colorado  \nConnecticut: HuskyHealth, Husky C (for aged, blind or disabled persons)  \nDelaware: Diamond State Health Plan (Plus)  \nFlorida: Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program (SMMC), Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program, Long-term Care (LTC) Program  \nGeorgia: PeachState  \nHawaii : MedQuest  \nIdaho: Medicaid  \nIllinois: Medical Assistance Program, AllKids, FamilyCare  \nIndiana: Hoosier Healthwise, Hoosier Care Connect, M.E.D.

One thing to keep in mind when reading Reddit is that it's usually only the people who had bad experiences who are inspired to share about it online. The vast, vast majority of doctor appointments are totally unremarkable.\n\nIf you're just going in for a physical, they will probably check your height and weight and take your blood pressure. The provider will have you take deep breaths while they listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, first on your chest and then on your back. They might press their fingers around your neck and jaw to feel your lymph nodes there, and look in your eyes, nose, and ears. Since you're in your 40's, they may order lab work, which usually means you have to go elsewhere to get blood drawn. These may be \"fasting\" labs (which means you can't eat for 8-12 hours beforehand) so they can check your cholesterol and/or glucose. They will ask you questions about how you're feeling in general, both physically and emotionally, and whether you have any specific health complaints that you want to address.\n\nIf you don't have a specific health problem you're trying to solve, the point of these tests is to establish a baseline. Then, if you continue to do annual checkups, your provider will be able to compare each year's results to the previous year; any changes to your baseline can help them identify problems and recommend treatments or lifestyle changes to mitigate anything that comes up.\n\nYou should absolutely be open with your provider that you are nervous about the appointment and haven't sought medical care in many years. The odds that any provider would laugh at you or shame you in any way is very, very low. It's not likely they'll mention it at all! If anything, you might get a fist bump for overcoming your anxiety and taking steps to safeguard your health.",

The property I am at has struggled historically. Prior to this I was a supervisor mostly dealing with Front Desk.\n\nIn addition to being a bit overwhelmed, I have been moved into our Executive Housekeeping Position with no housekeeping experience. This would be fine; since it\u2019s good experience to have as a manager in general, but this property has failed its last two \u201cQA\u201d inspections so I haven\u2019t been thrilled to inherit this difficult title as a new AGM with no housekeeping experience other than room\nInspections. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m at my hotel until at least July, because I signed a relocation agreement. However I\u2019m so burnt out I\u2019m considering taking the financial hit and doing something else. I\u2019m burnt out (did I say that!?), we have an extremely weak hiring pool, turnover is high, and it\u2019s a super old hotel which doesn\u2019t help service scores. \n\nHas anyone been in this spot? Worked with someone who\u2019s been in this spot? Have you broken a relocation agreement? What was your experience? Have you been pushed into a department or role that you had no desire for or experience in? I need some people who\u2019ve been in this longer than me to share their experiences, because my experience as a frontline manager, and now half an exec, has not been the experience I\u2019d hoped for when relocating for this promotion.\n\nThanks!

Ideally I want you to stay for 6 months to a year, but there are times I might knowingly hire somebody for 3 months whilst they\u2019re home for summer for example. The only complexity in your role is likely to be the processes/systems, so as long as you can get to grips with them then training doesn\u2019t require much investment.\n\nWhen talking about job hopping, that\u2019s a consideration for MANAGERS. If I\u2019m hiring a manager (again, a role I\u2019ve hired for many, many times) then the investment I put into them will be considerable, and yes I want to see  evidence that the investment is likely to be returned by them staying in the company for longer than a year.\n\nMy advice is to not be a passenger in life and go for what you want. Make direct, unsolicited approaches to business owners/Operations Managers looking for roles that aren\u2019t yet advertised. Read/listen to \u2018Setting The Table\u2019 by Danny Meyer and \u2018Unreasonable Hospitaity\u2019 by Will Guidara and use the frameworks in these to guide how you communicate moving forwards. \n\nGood luck.",

I always make a point since becoming a manager of not getting TOO drunk. The night revolved around me having to kick a KP out of the party for inappropriate behaviour but it got worse at the end. \n\nOur GM got very drunk and became very.. creepy. It wasn\u2019t until Sunday when me and the ops manager came in and heard a few people talking that we realised there were some more serious allegations we needed to investigate which we did immediately. \n\nNow I was there and I didn\u2019t know the full story, all I knew was he was being a bit creepy so I walked a female receptionist home and walked a female housekeeper home, then had to escort my GM to his bedroom because he tried to push his way into an F&B team members bedroom, while he threw a hail of abuse my direction. \n\nWe completed our investigation and sent it directly to HR. HR was attending a staff party Sunday night at one of our other hotels but went up to her office to look into it because of the severity. Our HR manager is lovely, and I know what recommendation she made to the CEO (dismissal). \n\nCome Monday morning, the ops manager who is a woman, now knowing his behaviour didn\u2019t feel safe working with the GM so asked me to re arrange shifts around to be on with her in the morning which I did and we had to rearrange the morning receptionist as she was one of the ones effected so she wouldn\u2019t see the GM. \n\nWe expected the GM to arrive at work and be fairly swiftly dismissed. This didn\u2019t happen. We went over to the CEO\u2019s office and demanded to know the results of the investigation which included 6 witness statements and CCTV footage. He said that, he wasn\u2019t going to dismiss him since he is leaving and his last day is this Friday anyway. We told him that was simply unacceptable. He asked us to rearrange all affected staff members to not work this week which I went mental at. \n\nAs it stands, I told him \u201cif he is staying then he can run F&B this week because I won\u2019t work under the same roof as him. I\u2019ll return to work on Saturday when he has left.\u201d The head chef has also taken this approach. I have also briefed my team that anyone who does not feel comfortable working with him, I will not hold it against them or issue any of them with AWOL status for any shifts they don\u2019t attend until Saturday. \n\nAs it stands there is me, the Head Chef, Bar and Restaurant Manager, 2 housekeepers and 3 receptionists refusing to work until Saturday and still no decision made to get rid of him. \n\nSo with that, job applications went out today.

        "content": "4 Years \nI have worked Night Audit for 4 years and my health is steadily declining because of it. I have asked for opportunities to move up after year one, but because I work night shift and never see much of anyone I suppose I\u2019m easy to forget. This year I am determined. Ive got a goal to become sales manager. I\u2019ve taken the online courses the hotel provides, I\u2019ve done research, I\u2019ve written out plans, made contacts with locals, I have an entire binder filled with ideas and plans in order to bring up our sales not only in our usual busy times but while it is dead as well and I\u2019ve proven I can do such. \nI feel like I\u2019m wasting my breath though. Apparently the owner doesn\u2019t want to spend the money on a separate position and would rather put these responsibilities under the GM\u2019s responsibilities. I\u2019ve asked for just training at least so I can take the skills elsewhere. I\u2019ve applied for positions at other hotels but as soon as they see I don\u2019t have any sales experience it\u2019s an automatic no. It doesn\u2019t matter how stacked my resume is with the educational courses, the work I\u2019ve done, none of it matters. I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re going to let me do some of the paperwork for sales while I work at night as well as a minor pay raise but I feel like it\u2019s just to placate me more than anything. My goal is to get out of night shift but I feel like I\u2019m just chained here. My regional manager told me that because I\u2019m so reliable and work hard on my night shift and never cause any problems that my managers want to keep me there. I know I should just leave, but I can\u2019t get anywhere else with training and experience and I don\u2019t want to start at square one again. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. ",

        "content": "Completely Fed up With Upper Management\nI think the title really says it all, but let me get into the details.\n\nI've (31F)  been working at the same hotel for nearly two years, and the Front Desk Manager for nearly a year this April. This position was actually created for me, so it was kind of a huge deal at the time. For the most part, I love my job. Of course, every job has it's ups and downs, but for the most part, it's a good job, it pays well (considering the area that I'm living in) and I love the team that I've made.\n\nBut I *hate* my General Manager.\n\nShe came into her position around June of last year, with absolutely NO hotel experience before. Which, isn't a problem in it's own right, but if you work in a hotel, you know that it's a whole new experience and isn't for the faint of heart.\n\nAnyways, our old GM left soon after, and everything has just gone downhill from there.\n\nOrders are getting missed, pay roll is constantly fucked up, she doesn't support her managers (specifically me), and won't learn how to run the actual hotel system. So she can't make reservations, look reservations up, even look into the AR accounts. There has been multiple times where she's asked me for help (which is fine, I'm happy to help) on things that I simply shouldn't be involved in (Pay roll, AR accounts, Billing not related to guest reservations, etc).\n\nAs of late, I feel that she and my AGM are giving me absolutely no support.   \n  \nFor example, just this Sunday, my night auditor (11p-7a) quit on me 20 minutes before her shift began. So, despite my working 8 hours earlier and getting no sleep, I went in to cover the desk (which, I know is part of my job description, totally fair). I messaged both her and my AGM letting them both know that one of my front desk agents would be coming in early tomorrow by her own accord so that I could get some sleep (I was supposed to also cover the 7a-3p shift the next morning, basically clocking me at 24 hours at work over a 36 hour period or so).\n\nBy the time that my agent made it in, I had been awake for 25 hours. As soon as she got there, I went to sleep and slept for about 12 hours before I got up to get ready for my 11p-7a shift tonight.\n\nOf course, I heard NOTHING from either of them. Not in the evening (which I didn't expect), or in the morning. It wasn't until I messaged my AGM asking if he could take the desk over until my employee got here, and he agreed, but she arrived long before he did.\n\nNow I'm in hot water because my front desk agent is going to be going over time by about 11 hours this week.\n\nOvertime must ALWAYS be approved through my GM, which I understand, but how in the world am I supposed to get a hold of her when she won't answer any of my calls or texts? And I wasn't about to sit here for an extra 2-3 hours until she arrives in the morning and then extra time on top of that getting someone to cover (note: my AGM never offered to actually take the shift. Just to cover until the other agent got there).\n\nAnd this is how it is. Over and over again. I've tried explaining to her that overtime is basically inevitible on a hotel front desk, and that having one employee go a few hours overtime costs less than having a full time employee on the desk, especially since I cover 75% of the shifts.\n\nIt's not just that, it's a whole slew of things. The chain of command is fucked, communication is apparently only a one way street, they'll both offer to jump if housekeeping or breakfast needs help, but I just get to flounder.\n\nIt's been an entire mess and I'm at a loss. I'm the manager that's in the first chain of command for ANYTHING, including mechanical & housekeeping situations. I'm expected to call/text everyone who calls/texts me immediately, no matter what time of day, but when I try to get hold of either of them, I won't get any sort of response. Then, I get ripped apart for making time sensitive decisions.\n\nI feel like everything is being thrown on me and I don't even know where to begin. I have half a mind to resign from my position and just take the full time NA position that's just opened up.\n\nMy AGM claims that he's always here to help me, but I feel like that's bullshit, too. He knows how to cover the desk just as well as I do, but he doesn't. And my GM doesn't know how to do anything on the desk, so it's not like I can ask her for anything.\n\nI'm at a loss. And maybe this is just a rant. I don't know. I hate that she makes me hate my job, especially since I loved it so damn much before she came around.",

She kept telling herself things would get better and more stable once she got to that level.  But now she has been fired 3 times in the past 2 years. First, a company sold her hotel and the new owner was planning on doing a major renovation.  The next was a smaller property and could not justify her salary.  She has not figured out the real reason for this third one, however the owners have fired 10 of their 12 GMs in her region this year.  \n\nShe is frustrated with never being stable.  Is this the usual experience in this industry?  What other industries/jobs would be good to move into that would use her skill set?",

It was probably due to a number things that were my fault, the previous GMs fault, as the fact that the franchisee/owners were located across the country. \n\nIt got to a point that if my staff found out I was taking PTO for a trip or going out of town for my weekend they would purposely call in and then join together and all refuse to work the shift. \n\nI dreaded my phone ringing or a text coming in. My last week of the 45 day notice I worked I ended up coming down with a horrible case of Covid. I was very very sick and worked through a whole weekend before getting my PCR results back. I ended up working back to back 7-11 shifts on Sat/Sun. \n\nTold my boss and he said do not cover any more call ins during this week. Direct them to me. Which I did but man, someone called me every single day of that week trying to get me to come to the hotel while I was legit dying of Covid \n\nAll this is to say, I would suggest finding a role outside of hotels. She has TONS of useful skills that can be applied in many man industries. The sheer amount of stress handled on a day to day basis is enough to get a job doing literally any kind of people management job. \n\nEscape while she can!!!",

Currently 46yr old and working as GM for high volume restaurant in a boutique hotel (50 rooms - Restaurant does approx 3.5 million a year not including events) . Been here three years now and am lined up for the F&B director position. My boss the F&B director just got promoted to Director of Property. The hotel manager walked out and now I\u2019m being asked to become the Hotel Manager. They are not replacing the F&B position currently. He\u2019s going to keep some of his responsibilities and distribute others. \n\nI love my job and the people I work for. It s family owned business and they take very good care of me.  The new position also comes with a 5 figure raise and I still book private events for the restaurant and get commission off those bookings. \n\nMy concern is I love the restaurant industry. I never even thought about working or managing a hotel for that matter. Just ended up here. Another part of this is the hotel is 24/7 obviously. So as the manager I\u2019m basically on call 24/7 and will be covering shifts when employees call out specifically the midnight shift. Currently I\u2019m out by 10-11pm. Had some health issues in the past and not sure about the hours. \n\nPart of me wants to take it and then I\u2019ll be ready for my bosses job when he leaves as he\u2019s planning on retiring in another 2-3 years. \n\nThe other part of me wants to keep building my F&B experience in case i need to go somewhere else if the business ever gets sold or for whatever reason I\u2019m not there. My direct boss who got the promotion is pushing for it. He\u2019s only ever worked in one hotel. All his career is F&B. He keeps telling me it\u2019s a good move. I also know it\u2019ll make his life easier another reason he\u2019s pushing hard. \n\nI feel like I don\u2019t want to switch career paths at this stage in my life. \n\nApologies for the long post but appreciate any advice.

I went to the trial shift and I was anxious about carrying trays and things, because I am prone to clumsiness and I'm not the strongest. The interview stage went fine, but the manager insisted that they wouldn't be considering hiring anyone if they were not able to work in December, the busiest time. At the time, I said this is all fine and I can do it. I didn't even think I'd get the job after my trial, I was attentive to customers but I felt my anxiety was very obvious. The last time I worked in a restaurant was when I was 15 and I left the job quickly after spilling a whole tray of drinks on someone. The tables are very spaced out in this restaurant so I have to keep a hold of the tray while I put the glasses down, and the thought of me losing balance of the tray mortifies me. One week later, I get a call from the restaurant letting me know I got the job. The thought of going back to the restaurant to work makes me feel dread because of the pressure I put on myself to do a good job, and the interacting with the customers & complaints. That being said, I feel I need to push myself out of my comfort zone and push myself to be better because I don't want to be controlled by fear. The anxiety part aside, my home is 4 hours away and I have two little sisters that I miss very much. I'm concerned I'll be expected to work Christmas Eve or the day before (Christmas Day & Boxing Day I'm allowed off), which would then mean I wouldn't be able to come home for Christmas to see my family. All of my housemates will have gone home for the Christmas break and I'll be stuck serving at a place 4 hours away from home. The pay is only minimum wage - I think \u00a311.25 or I hope at least. Considering coursework too, would it be wise to take the job? I feel like I can't live in fear and turn down opportunities. I called my mum to ask her advice and she just shouted at me that I shouldn't take the job and that I'll be stuck there while everyone has gone home. I don't know what to do. Please help!!",

        "content": " Starting a Customer Experience Consultancy \u2013 Your Input Needed!\nHey everyone!\n\nI\u2019m in the early stages of starting a consultancy/customer experience auditing company. This has been a passion of mine for a while, and I believe there\u2019s a huge opportunity to help small and medium-sized businesses elevate their guest experience and store standards. I literally visit\na grocery store for regular grocery shopping and spot issues without looking, same for almost all hotel rooms I book it\u2019s just second nature to me. \n\nHaving worked in various customer service and operational roles, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how small details can make a big difference in how customers perceive a business. Often, there\u2019s a disconnect between what businesses think they\u2019re offering and what customers actually experience. From improving service consistency to addressing maintenance issues, I want to offer tailored, a la carte services that can make a real impact.\n\nI\u2019d love to get any input as I shape this venture. \n\nWhat are some of the biggest shortcomings you\u2019ve noticed in customer experience today?\nWhat services or improvements do you think businesses need but aren\u2019t getting?\nWhether you\u2019re a business owner or a customer, your feedback would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights and opinions \u2013 I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing your thoughts and making this idea a reality!",

                "content": "I think this is an awesome idea! I've been in the customer service industry for over 20 years and it can be so frustrating to come across flaws in the service provided by others. It's commendable, what you're doing. :) \n\nHere are some tips that I could compile just from my experience. \n\nThere can be a lot of inconsistencies in how a customer is treated. It can vary based on the employee, time of day, or location. There are many factors that play into what makes service great and each interaction with a customer is unique, but inconsistencies can leave the customers feeling uncertain.\n\nA huge aspect of customer service these days (especially with AI and so much automation) is a customized experience for the customer. According to [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/customer-experience-trends/), 50% of customers are willing to share personal information for a more personalized experience.\n\nAnother thing to consider is proper communication, both between the employees and coworkers, and the employees and customers. Communication is key for not only consistency, but also preventing confusion and frustration. \n\nI think something that is becoming more prevalent is a lack of empathy. Oftentimes, a customer will share a complaint with an employee, but the customer doesn't feel heard because the employee oftentimes did not convey proper empathy. This can be tricky to learn how to do properly when you're beginning, but it can also grow old fast when you're an experienced representative. It's definitely necessary though.\n\nI think process optimization and standardizing operations is also crucial. Long wait times, complicated procedures, and confusing websites or apps can deter customers. You can also utilize customer journey mapping to help identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. (There's always room for improvement, nothing is perfect.)\n\nI typically don't have difficulty picking up a new task, or being trained to a new position. However, I have stumbled across a company or two who had notoriously bad training for the employees. This trickles down to the customer experience, and causes loss of faith in the company from the customer's perspective.  \n\nI'm sure you're well aware of all of the tools at your disposal to gain invaluable insights, like surveys, online reviews, and social media monitoring. This can all be indispensable for a business to keep on top of service levels. I think it's especially important when you're dealing with a small business because people expect a small business to go the extra mile. \n\nOne final thing I might want to suggest is providing free consultations. You said you're working with small businesses primarily. A small business owner always has 1 thing on their mind, bottom line. It's going to be very important that you sell your service by explaining the value that your service provides for their business and in turn their customers. A free consultation will give you the opportunity to help review some areas for improvement, demonstrating to the business that your services are going to benefit them. \n\nAnyway, I apologize for how longwinded this was. I hope you're able to find it helpful, and best of luck with your endeavor!",

That is restaurant, bar, and banquet at a small boutique luxury hotel. Never worked in a bar. Never worked in a full service restaurant. Never even carried 3 plates at once. \n\nHonestly I interviewed well.  I sold what I knew which was how to be profitable. I was an assistant general manager for the fast casual restaurant. \n\nI got lucky in that the staff was very experienced so I didn't have to train anyone new. I learned a lot from them very fast. I took a lot of notes. I knew I had to catch up quickly because they did take a chance on me.\n\nNow I work in banqueting and events specifically with a plan to pivot to sales. \n\nI do not have a hospitality degree.\n\nI think if you want to get into revenue management, you should consider being a front desk agent or supervisor so you learn the room division.

Since you are already working your way up, you should be okay to take on the role with the certification, (and other roles in this field as well). All that is truly needed is previous experience, plus the certification. The certification can be done within 6 to 8 months online, at your own pace ,and I have seen some for as low as $1000, whereas a master's would take you an additional 1 to 2 years, but when run you a lot of money.",

I just moved to NYC, which is a much tougher market for hospitality jobs than what I'm used to. I've always put both my teaching and hospitality work on my resume, under those categories, so I can show continuity of employment. Is that a huge mistake? Should I just put hospitality work only on that resume? If I do that, I'll have gaps in employment--can that just be explained on a cover letter? I have three years of serving experience, including 2 years of fine dining and a year of bartending, and I'm not getting interviews from my applications off of indeed, etc.  I know that's not much for NYC, and it's not NYC experience, but I have to start somewhere, and I need some advice. I'm shooting for catering gigs for now. Thanks so much.",

This has always been a difficult industry, particularly during COVID when travel evaporated, but now I genuinely think we're seeing a seismic shift that we won't entirely recover from.\n\nRevenues have been down industry-wide ever since COVID. An incredible amount of our business came from companies sending their associates all over the place and staying in our hotels, creating a comfortable base of financial support from which we could build on with additional groups, social events, conventions, etc. But during COVID companies largely shifted to utilizing tools like Zoom, Teams, etc. so that level of travel just isn't required. As such, travel went down significantly.\n\nMeanwhile also during the pandemic labor costs increased. This was much overdue and the industry needed to catch up to others to offer competitive salaries, but it still majorly increased the expense for a hotel to remain operational. That combination of lower travel/less revenue combined with higher expenses (not to mention inflated costs of living) led to 2023 being one of the worst years for hotel performance industry-wide on record. \n\nAdditionally, during COVID a lot of hotel owners sold their properties and newer, less experienced owners bought them up. The hotels weren't bringing in enough revenue to keep up on basic maintenance needs, so that now any hotel older than 10 years has aged like it's twice that old and requires an even bigger investment to get it back up to speed, which most owners don't want to do for obvious reasons. The big brands like Hilton, Marriott, IHG, and Hyatt all cracked down on their quality specifications, knowing that properties would fail their inspections and then have to pay more to them in fees (because the Brands also took massive hits and needed to recoup some revenue.)\n\nNow we're looking at advances in AI and computing power so that it's hard to see some basic elements of a hotel such as the Front Desk or the Sales departments sticking around for more than 5 more years or so. Labor makes up the largest share of expenses at a hotel property, usually accounting for around 40% or so. If you could cut 20-30% of that, wouldn't you?\n\nPeople will always need hotels of course. People need a place to stay. But here pretty soon, it looks increasingly to me like we're going to lose half of the staff in this industry and their roles will be moved to computers and smartphones. And for those of us in the industry, it seems like we better start looking at new industries pretty quick, if it's not already too late.",

Any insights are greatly appreciated!\n\nFor context, I am currently living in the DMV. I work full-time, live alone, and have a dog (a senior maltese mix in case you were wondering). I am coming in with an external living stipend ($18k), and (hopefully; pending current government) have a job lined up after graduating at State. I am pursuing international economic development policy.\n\nI would be taking about 6k in loans for tuition/fees at the University of Michigan per year (unsure about health insurance). I am interested in the Weiser Diplomacy Center, and the classes seem really interesting. Overall, it seems like a spirited approachable community! I am primarily concerned about housing (especially with a pet) and the winter. I've noticed a lot of places do not allow pets, and I am worried about finding affordable housing/roommates, etc. \n\nAlternatively, I'm wondering if it is feasible to work full-time and do my MPP at McCourt. Are most classes in the evening?  I am worried I may struggle balancing a challenging curriculum and a job. Luckily, my team is pretty on board with me doing my master's. I would be paying around $7k out of pocket (taken from my living stipend) and get to keep my health insurance and my apartment. The curriculum seems pretty quant-heavy, but I am motivated to learn. I've heard mixed things about McCourt's community, and wonder whether I may even have time for a social life.\n\nAny advice is appreciated! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Yet when I compared the curriculum to similarly rated or better programs, my program has significantly fewer for electives. \n\nTo be specific, several of the other programs (Rutgers, U Virginia, UMass) require 4-6 elective classes. My program only requires one, and the options for policy areas are also comparatively limited. Note that the total hours for all compared programs are about the same at 37 hours. \n\nFor those of you who have been through an MPP or have professional policy experience, is this lack of specialization something that should be of worry to me? The degree has a solid amount of required courses to cover everything from econometrics to organizational theory and government information systems, but I will only get one formal chance to study a policy area for an entire class. And if I should worry, what are some ideas to learn more about the policy areas that I am interested in (urban and environmental)?",

I\u2019m an international student from India, and while I have received some funding, I will still need to rely on loans and my existing savings to finance any of these options. I\u2019d love to hear thoughts from others who have experience with these schools or similar decisions.\n\nHere are the programs I\u2019ve been admitted to:\n\t1.\tUniversity of Chicago (MPP) \u2013 $50k funding (I\u2019ve applied for reconsideration)\n\t2.\tMcCourt School of Public Policy (MIDP) \u2013 $60k funding (I\u2019ve applied for reconsideration)\n\t3.\tColumbia University SIPA (MPA) \u2013 $80k funding\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on the following factors:\n\n1. Academic Quality\n\nHow do the programs compare in terms of academic rigor and the opportunities available for specialized studies? How are the faculty members regarded in their fields?\n\n2. Placements and Job Opportunities\n\nWhat is the quality of the career services at each school? How strong are the job placements and internship opportunities in both the public and private sectors, especially for international students?\n\n3. Brand Value and Global Recognition\n\nHow does the brand value of these schools differ in terms of global recognition, particularly in India and other emerging markets? How might the reputation of each program impact long-term career prospects?\n\n\n4. Cost of Living and Location\n\nThe cost of living in each city is a big factor. What is the affordability of life in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York City? How do these locations compare in terms of networking opportunities and professional communities?\n\n5. Post-Graduation Work Opportunities (OPT and H-1B)\n\nHow supportive are these programs in helping international students navigate post-graduation work opportunities (e.g., OPT, H-1B)? What are the specific challenges faced by international students in these cities?\n\n\nI understand that this is a very personal decision, and I greatly appreciate any input or experiences others can share.

                "content": "Negotiate with Chicago. You're in a great position to have all that aid from those other schools, I know they'll give you more money.\n\n\nSIPA is a good school, but even with an $80k scholarship, the cost of living in NYC will eat through your expenses fast.\n\n\nAnother reason to give UChicago or McCourt a\u00a0 consideration is that their MPP is STEM certified (not sure about MIDP specifically though), which gives you more time in the US. The MPA at SIPA is not STEM certified.\n\n\nI can't speak for the other schools (though I can speak to DC as a location, as I am from the DMV), but I can speak for Harris.\n\n\n1. Academic Quality:\n\n\nIt's very strong at Harris. The core curriculum is very academically rigorous and teaches you a lot of hard quant skills, and there are pathways you can take such as the data analysis specialization or finance specialization that can help you further develop your technical skills.\n\n\n2. Job Placement and Opportunities:\n\n\nThey're a hit or miss. There's definitely a lot of students who do well for themselves at Harris and land top flight jobs and internships, but if you're a career changer or you don't have much experience, it can be really hard. Career services at Harris could improve in a lot of ways. Lots of students are told to just \"go in LinkedIn,\" and the networking events on campus heavily skew towards consulting and environmental policy. However, the Institute of Politics and UChicago as a whole have great networking opportunities.\u00a0 Career coaches at Harris can be very helpful with helping you create a solid resume and cover letter, as well as giving you pointers on how to network.\n\n\n3. Brand Value and Name Recognition\u00a0\n\n\nCan't really speak to how Harris is perceived in India.\n\n\n4. Cost of Living\u00a0\n\n\nSurprisingly high. Not NYC, San Francisco, or LA high, but pretty much on par with DC in terms of rent prices, which is insane to me. I was shocked to find out that even $2k doesn't really take you that far in much of Hyde Park or much else of Chicago. That's basically the starting price for your own place with in unit laundry. Two apartment companies have a stronghold on the market in Hyde Park, and price gouging is rampant. The stock is also very limited. I've also found that groceries are more expensive in Chicago than they are in DC. It will be much cheaper than SIPA living costs though.",

GSPP\u2019s MPP was the only program I had applied to (I live and work in Oakland, and want my long-term career to be focused on policy here), so a bit bittersweet to have not gotten into the MPP but still offered admission to the MPA. I\u2019ve done a bit of research and the program seems reputable, and would seemingly still teach me many of the skills I applied to the MPP for (an analytical/quantitative skillset for policy research & implementation). \n\nHowever I haven\u2019t found much discussion about the degree online, and am wondering if a Master of Public Affairs degree from Goldman will still get me where I want to go. So a few questions: \n\n1. How reputable (especially in the Bay Area) is GSPP\u2019s MPA? Does it hold a similar value to the school\u2019s MPP? \n\n2. Does a Master of Public Affairs degree hold weight in the job market? Do prospective employers in the policy advocacy/nonprofit/public sector see this degree as valuable?\n\nWould especially appreciate any insight from GSPP MPA grads for any thoughts! ",

I'm a government employee and will be returning to my home country's government after completing my 2-year degree.\n\nI'm receiving partial tuition and living expense funding from my government. SIPA has also offered me a scholarship, which means I can likely cover all my expenses for two years in NYC without additional personal funds (total estimated cost: $270k). HKS, however, hasn't offered any scholarships, requiring me to spend an additional $80k of my own savings.\n\nIn my home country, Harvard has a slightly higher name recognition than Columbia. Since I have the $80k saved, I could afford HKS. However, given that my career path is already set, I'm wondering if the additional $80k for a Harvard degree is truly worthwhile. I'd greatly appreciate any insights you can share.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to ask if a $270k budget is sufficient for two years in NYC while attending SIPA. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance !",

It\u2019s literally my dreeeeaaamm school + program! So safe to say I was so excited and overjoyed.\n\nThat said, after I shared the news with friends/colleagues, many shared that I made a mistake and should\u2019ve instead applied to the 2-Year MPA or MPP instead. This is due to my cohort being significantly older than me (as a 28 yr old) with ~7 years of experience as I graduated college early (classmates will have 10/15+ years work exp). My excitement faded and I started feeling major anxiety about networking and building friendships. I am an international student and never been nor lived in the US. I also have never lived alone (I went to college in my hometown). I am worried about the \u201cclique-y\u201d culture at HKS and this experience being lonely.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve attended HKS or the MC/MPA, do you think my friends/colleagues are right? Are my worries are valid? Any opinions are greatly appreciated!!\n\n**KEY NOTE: I initially chose the MC/MPA due it being 1 year and my workplace would provide funding for executive grad programs.",

I had turned down some MC/MPA program admissions offers due to the average cohort age range being far outside of mine. I had felt that the cohort experience was extremely important as I presumed I would learn as much if not more from my peers than the professors, so your anxiety is totally understandable. I will say that other than the summer session, you will have plenty of opportunities to interact and build relationships with the 2 year MPPs and MPAs as classes are mixed. You may likely gravitate towards hanging out with the younger spectrum of the cohort simply because of lifestyle, family obligations and bedtimes are different for the folks with more mileage. However, most people are nice and eager to be supportive and you should trust the process as to why you were selected. Younger classmates have a lot to offer as well, including being tech support and explaining TikTok trends and memes :) If this is the best program for you logistically then don\u2019t worry too much about the interpersonal relationships. You will find your people, the program size is large. The one year duration and subsidy considerations are completely valid to prioritize. Congrats, good luck and enjoy!",

I will be returning to my home country after graduation, so career prospects in the US is not a priority but internships during my time there is. \n\nGeorgetown is definitely in a prime location, but if I were to give up on Berkeley, I want to make sure I'm doing it for the right reason.\n\nWould love to hear any input regarding curriculum and how global it is (not just US focused), faculty, student life, practical experiences, and networking. \n\nFor now, let's assume financing is not a factor as I will be applying for a scholarship from my government.\n\nThank you in advance!",

                "content": "1) Yes, I did my MPP a few years before covid\n2) When the core courses needed to use specific policy examples, it was US-focused, but I know that was a complaint and something the administration was going to work on. I expect with the addition of the MDP program they would have now better incorporated more international examples. Of course, there are electives that are more international focused as well. This is something to ask about at an admitted students session. \n3) Yes, although it can depend on luck & courses. There are several former elected officials and government staff who teach classes (including the former mayor and city administrators of Oakland) and many of them work to bring policymakers and elected officials into the classrooms; when you do your internship, introductory policy analysis (IPA), and advanced policy analysis (APA or thesis), you also have many opportunities to work with policymakers and agencies as well. I did my IPA with a regional government agency, and I\u2019ve hired both IPA and APA students after graduation to work on local policy issues. \n3) Wide variety of internships, but often with government agencies or nonprofits, many of which are local or in Sacramento. A few students will do internships doing research with faculty, but I\u2019d say 95% were off-campus. \n\nHappy to answer any more questions here, or feel free to DM me!",

However, due to my non-econ background, I don't think my econ applications will be very successful, even though I have good letters of recommendation.\n\nI wanted to get a review of this program from people on this sub, about how future prospects will look like (for a non-American like me), and whether I can take extra-credit math courses to potentially apply for an econ-based PhD after this course.\n\nI am of course very thankful to get acceptance to a good school, but would definitely appreciate your thoughts on this.",

Since then I've worked some odd jobs but I've been working as an administrative assistant for the last two years in my county's Health Department.

I guess my question is given my current expierence and policy focus would it make more sense to get a masters or continue looking for a entry level policy analyst position, or try to get quantitative skills/certs independently of school/work. \n\nThe cheapest and closest masters degree in my state (NC) is a masters in public affairs which is ok but I would prefer a MPP so it's more policy focused. Also I would want to make sure grad school is the right move before I put that much money and time into it.

Seeking Advice!\nI've received almost all of my application decisions and now face a tough financial decision. I'd really appreciate your insights! If you have thoughts on the programs I've been accepted into, or whether it's worth taking on a student loan for a better program, please share your perspective.\n\n**About Me:**\n\nI'm an international student, coming straight from a bachelor's degree at a well-regarded European university. My long-term goal is a career in government ministries and public agencies in my home country in Europe. However, I also want to keep the option open to work for a few years in the U.S. (ideally in Washington, D.C.) in fields related to International Relations or Security Policy.\n\nI've been awarded a major external scholarship that provides about $1,500 monthly and covers a significant portion of my tuition fees. However, neither I nor my family have substantial financial resources to cover the remaining tuition. If you have insights into realistic living costs in these cities, that would be incredibly helpful, as I need a clear picture of the total expenses I might face.\n\n**The Big Question:** I've already secured full funding for the program at American University, so I can attend that without taking on debt. The key question is whether it would be worth it to take on a student loan to attend one of the other programs. Feel free to message me privately or comment directly under this post. Also, please mention if you're American or an international student (especially from Europe), as I'm interested in how valuable these degrees are back home.\n\n**Here are the universities and my current financial situations:**\n\n* **American University, School of International Service, M.A. in International Affairs Policy and Analysis**: Fully funded with no remaining tuition fees + offered a Research Assistantship (10 hrs/week), though the income from this will primarily cover tuition, leaving me with limited disposable income for living expenses.\n* **Duke University, Sanford School of Public Policy, MPP**: About $43,000 in remaining tuition fees.\n* **Georgetown University, Walsh School of Foreign Service, M.A. in Security Studies**: No tuition scholarship received, about $56,000 in remaining tuition fees.\n* **University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy, MPP**: About $65,000 in remaining tuition fees.\n* **Johns Hopkins, SAIS, M.A. in International Relations**: Waitlisted.\n* **Harvard Kennedy School, MPP**: Rejected.\n\nI'm looking forward to your thoughts! Please feel free to discuss all aspects, including location, costs, and return on investment for a career in International Relations and Security Policy.\n\nI applied to both MPP and IR/Security Studies programs, as I want to combine quantitative methods with IR/Security Studies in the future. This required some compromises in my choice of master's programs.\n\nGiven my career goal in the public sector, I anticipate an average salary for my country, which makes taking on significant debt a challenging prospect.\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback!",

Math degree w CS &Stats minor and ML research experience. Compared to others, I dont have much relevant background/experience in policy. Most of the program that i applied to was DS/Computational analysis n policy interdisciplinary programs (like MSCAPP) bc thats what I mostly want to do but I didnt get into MSCAPP but rather got offered position to MPP. From what I had assumed, my background fits better into MSCAPP but ig not? \n\nWhat would be the possible reason that I was offered MPP over MSCAPP?",

I have to say MSCAPP is fitting you better if you have stronger stem background and have curiosity and interest in policy and social science issues. MSCAPP cohort is much more smaller and more intensive in data, coding and cs cuz UChicago CS department is engaged and providing authentic classes in cs. MPP is much larger about 400-500 people recruited this year. I would recommend you to apply for MSCAPP cuz you have very stem bg so just demonstrate your interest in which social issues or policy interest you tend to address if you are admitted and that should be fine. Good Luck to you!",

        "content": "MPP Justification and Profile Review\nHi all! I come back to this want every once in a while, and I thought that before I applied, I would get the opinion of a public forum.\n\nI\u2019ve considered getting a MPP. I work in the mining industry doing corporate strategy and I\u2019m super proud of it. I\u2019m also a huge environmental advocate. I feel like my work is really contributing to the energy transition. In order to achieve this energy transition, we do have to begin to scale domestic mining drastically, wherein lies the problem.\n\nAnnually, the U.S. graduates ~200 students per year as mining engineers, while needing 2-5x that. China graduates 3,000 per year. China has a critical grip on the refinement of many metals, some of which are critical to national security. It is nearly impossible to open up a new refinery in the U.S., even with community buy-in and a clean environmental review. Among many other problems, the biggest issues in mining aren\u2019t geological, they are related to public policy.\n\nMy reasoning for pursuing a MPP is to become a critical change maker in policy, using my informed background in mining. Im hoping to create positive reform- not going as far as making it so a mine can be opened anywhere, but where minerals procurement and refinement can occur without choking on red tape. I\u2019m not sure the audience I\u2019m speaking to, maybe it\u2019s difficult to relate to where I\u2019m coming from (please don\u2019t downvote me into oblivion) but I\u2019m hoping that my justification makes sense. \n\nBackground: unranked undergrad, finance & economics, 3.72 gpa cum laude \nMasters degree in mineral and energy economics, 3.7 GPA\nStudied up on math and physics, then entered a Master of engineering in mining engineering. 3.8 gpa. 3 years work experience, hoping to get a bit more before applying (ideally 5). \n\nI\u2019ve seen some incredible backgrounds going into public policy, so I\u2019m unsure if mine makes much sense. \n\n[Edit: Initially I was attracted to UChicago because it has a heavy quant focus and it had a part time option so I could work. But I\u2019ve only seen horror stories of how people were treated by the school and the part time option seems to be fairly content light. Does anybody have any recommendations?]\n\nAgain- thank you everyone for reading my post. I hope it comes off as coherent!! ",

Other top schools for environmental policy typically include Duke, University of Washington, University of Michigan, probably UCLA. If you're specifically interested in federal policy, probably Harvard, Georgetown, University of Virginia. Carnegie Mellon is really strong on the intersection of engineering and public policy (they have both a MSPPM and an MS in EPP program). UT Austin has a petroleum engineering program so probably worth looking to see if there can be synergy there. \n\nI'd probably start with these before looking at lower-ranked / lower name brand schools. Other top schools I omitted for various reasons: Columbia comes up sometimes for environmental policy but IMO I'd stay away, I think it's just a honeypot for international students and people willing to pay too much money for the brand. Cornell is fine but I think the Ithaca campus is too far from anyplace that policy gets done, which is a detriment to an applied program like MPP. Princeton is pretty heavy on international policy, I've never heard of or met anyone in environmental policy out of Princeton.",

You've been working for a while, so you should consider your profile, the jobs you're interested in, and whether a grad degree (and which one) will get you where you want to go.\n\nLook at actual job opportunities. Look at past job opportunities and look up who was hired on LinkedIn. Ideally, you should apply to stuff and see if you're at least somewhat competitive as-is. Don't make this decision based on abstract ideas.\n\nIn many cases, a management degree is where you're more likely to see a bump if you've already shown that you can do policy or communications - an MBA or MPA, probably. If you want more responsibility and more compensation, it's probably by being a manager of analysts or communicators, not as a better analyst or communicator. Generalising can give you more options too.\n\nBut again, it depends. I'm looking at a 1 year MPP program that's full-time while still allowing me time to do consulting. Since I'm a director of policy, I don't think it would be particularly hard, but I bet it would give me a leg up when applying to VP policy and advocacy positions in larger organizations - but that's me targeting a small pool of competitive jobs and your best bet is probably targeting a larger pool of less-competitive jobs.",

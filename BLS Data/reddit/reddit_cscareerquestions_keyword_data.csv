post,2025-03-16 01:06:35,"How to define my job title
Hi all, I have worked for many years as a backend developer with focus on the DevOps part and occasionally did some front end as well (little). I have a master's degree in computer engineering and several academic research activities.

For the past few months I have been working in a new company where I am involved in:
- defining and developing automated end-to-end tests;
- develop and maintain internal tools useful for the developer experience;
- configure and maintain dev and test environments (releases, deployments, etc.);
- defining CI/CD pipelines to automate various processes;
- at the time of production release, I work alongside the SREs (having already deployed to the test environment, I anticipate their work).

Officially I have been framed as an “Automation Testing Engineer”, however, it seems reductive (I look like a mere tester in the eyes of future recruiters), I call myself ""Software Engineer in test/DevOps Engineer"" on my resume, I don't want to sound like I'm only doing testing, since I do a lot of different things

What do you think is the most appropriate title for my role?

Thank you to anyone who can give me advice.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jca1ug/how_to_define_my_job_title/

Does anyone know of an “emergency response” job in a technical field?

I’m currently a Software Engineer who prefers oncall/fire fighting work versus planning long-term goals and delivering on them. I do my best when something random comes up, and I have to figure out what to do about it versus a project where I have to design then implement then rinse and repeat.

Is there a related job more ideal for me? Such as maybe SRE or pen testing?

post,2025-03-15 13:46:45,"Torn between a pure CS degree, EE and CE
Im currently in senior/high school taking maths, further maths, physics and computer science A levels (british education system). 

I am very passionate about computer science and spend a good chunk of my spare time doing projects relating to it, but I dont know what degree to take. I think I would enjoy pure computer science but I worry a lot of it would be made much more competitive where less devs are needed due to AI, espescially software engineering. Its already extremely competitive as is. I enjoy physics but I find it much harder than maths or CS, so I think electrical engineering would be more difficult for me but I feel like future job prospects might be better (espescially with renewable energy sources, evs and demand for hardware with AI.

I also really enjoy lower level aspects of computer science like how storage devices function, cpu architecture, assembly and lower level languages like c++ and embedded systems (but I do not enjoy robotics). This makes me think computer engineering might be a good fit, but courses for that are very scarce in the 2 countries i can study (uk and nl) and it also seems limiting for going more into cybersecurty/software engineering/machine learning/more abstract side of cs which I also really enjoy. 

Most of my computer science so far has been programming and projects of my own which I really enjoy and I really enjoy logic problems and the feeling of solving something you were stuck on for ages, so i guess that leans more towards pure CS

post,2025-03-15 04:46:44,"As a middle eastern should I move to the US or Germany?
I (26M) am working as a software engineer and I want to leave my country and so far I have two options:
1. Go do masters (costs 20k usd annually) in the US and actively look for an employer that’s willing to sponsor my green card.
2. Go to Germany on a job sponsoring my blue card from the beginning.

Of course the Germany option seems more stable since I will be having a well-paying stable job from day 1 but it comes with trade offs like the need to learn German as quick as possible, and deal with how Germans treat foreigners specially since I am a person of color, and making significantly less money than what I can make in the US.

The trade offs at the US are that I don’t like the lifestyle at the US, expensive healthcare and education, and car-centeric cities, and higher criminality rates, and probably worse work-life balance. And also, very far from home so it might be challenging to maintain social relationships at my home country. But the most important problem is, it will be a must to find a job that sponsors my green card or H1B or else I will have paid an enormous amount of money and possibly got in a huge debt for nothing.

I read so many bad reviews about German tech market on reddit and much praise for the US. Do you agree with that?

Does anyone have an experience that can guide me where I should go? Does any of the trade offs I mentioned above have a higher weight that can lead to a decision?

Pretty much what the title says.

post,2025-03-14 22:39:59,"Feeling stuck but also grateful with my career. However, I think I want to switch.
# Background Info

I'm currently 28, from Toronto and I work as a full stack engineer making 95k CAD. I went to the University of Toronto and got a degree in stats but I had been coding since highschool and I only got a stats degree because ""Big data"" was the big buzzword when I was going into uni which is mostly stats based so I did that to ""future proof"" myself. Right out of uni I couldn't get a job for like a year due to covid and with me not having a cs degree, I couldn't get much interviews but eventually on my second interview, I passed with colors and I joined a startup and I've been there almost 4 years.

I understand the job market is tough right now and I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I'm making close to 6 figures in Toronto but I'm just not satisfied. I also know that my company is going to be sold in 1-2 years so I need to start thinking about what I want to do after.

# Question

I'm basically trying to see if there's any other fields that I can potentially switch into, which utilizes my skillset and pays just as much if not more than as an engineer. The obvious answer to make more money is to stay in the software engineering field but I just hate leetcode style questions with a passion but sadly that's needed to get into those companies that pay the big bucks. I'm terrible at remembering algorithms and while I believe myself to be a very good engineer, I just suck at leetcode. I can tackle easy/mediums pretty effortlessly but hard questions are pretty difficult for me.

Now, on to what I am good at. 

* I'm good at thinking about issues big picture, so more geared towards system design I guess? I find system design really interesting so I've watched a lot of videos on how twitter, fb, doordash, etc, were made so I'm pretty good at coming up with cost effective solutions that balance scalability and ease of use. I've built quite a few full stack apps that I host on my own Hetzner VPS and I've set everything up from scratch and have had no issues
* I'm also not a terrible coder. I constantly google and chatgpt everything (which I think is a skill in it's own right) but I've never come across an issue that I haven't been able to solve. I actually used to take a leetcode style approach to everything where I would try to optimize algorithms as much as possible till I was told that sometimes while the N^2 approach is definitely worse than N, it really doesn't matter if N is only 10 (basically our company at it's core is just doing CRUD operations on a DB, so stop trying to over engineer things and just do it cleanly and quickly)
* **And where I shine the most**, I have incredible soft skills and great communication. Everyone in my company thinks so and I'm constantly the person that explains the technical things to the business people. Maybe it's because I'm an idiot but usually when our engineers and management speak, it's chaos till I come in and explain everything to both sides in a way that they understand. I'm also not awkward at all (which I know is a stereotype with engineers) and my people skills are top notch imo


I do enjoy what I do, and I'm proud that I joined a startup very early on and with only 2 engineers (me and CTO), we've built it into a platform that is actually generating a decent amount of money, (and maybe this is because we're a remote company) but I really don't see myself being good at leetcode and grinding for a SWE job where I'm just working on a codebase and barely interacting with people and just slaving away at tickets.

Also even though I have a stats degree, I haven't done anything stats related in 4 years so I have 0 memory of anything stats related so don't read too much into that.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read this!",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jbghbb/feeling_stuck_but_also_grateful_with_my_career/
post,2025-03-14 13:55:44,"Uninspired in current role. I miss coding.
Sorry if this comes off as an ungrateful rant. 

I was a full stack developer prior to my current role TC 60k. Current role TC 80k + pretty decent benefits and flexibility but in public sector. At my old job, I pretty much programmed all day - Python/PHP/.net + random other languages for different random apps they had. I also worked pretty independently and genuinely enjoyed just coding all day. I was very productive and genuinely enjoyed my work. I had the freedom to improve code when I saw things that weren't done properly and clean up a lot of our applications (add data validation etc.) Even back then I didn't even feel like I was using my skills fully and wanted to do more, so I left and joined my current org where I got a 25% bump in pay and became salaried. 

In my current role I'm doing strictly backend integration stuff, as almost all our software is third party and my role is to just integrate data between them. I occasionally am asked to write new packages to perform new tasks, but it is rare and there's a LOT of red tape in my role so I end up slowly working on something pretty simple over several months, trying to collect requirements and a lot of testing/validation with end users. My title is now 'software engineer', it just feels like an empty title. I do a lot more project management and am in a lot more meetings. I code A LOT less. Maybe that's all titles are anyway? I just wanted to code. 

I LOVE programming. I am currently in school still, finishing up the bachelors then getting my masters. My projects at school are so much fun, it feels so good to code :( I've offered to make little websites for friends who have small businesses on the side, just to use some of the skills I have and get myself to code. I've also written a lot of stuff in google workspace, little tools for my husband and I to manage our finances and automate emails/calendar stuff. I think doing a little leetcode everyday might help as well?

  
Does anyone have any advice for me? My current role is incredibly flexible and stable. I also have great tuition reimbursement (90%). I have two children and am in college so I plan on staying... But I don't want to lose my skills or my passion for programming. It feels like ever since I went from full stack development to this current position, I am barely coding. I mostly am in meetings talking through requirements and doing a lot more project related tasks, then when I code its backend integration but its not very often.

How can I make the most of this situation?",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1japm4b/concerned_that_my_new_job_will_hurt_my_future/
comment,2025-03-14 03:25:28,"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It can feel like you're stuck doing the same SQL tasks over and over when you were expecting more variety and creative coding challenges. But here’s the thing: every job, especially early on, teaches you something—even if it doesn’t seem glamorous.

First off, don’t sweat it too much. Many fresh graduates have been in similar situations where the role isn’t a full-on coding adventure. Those repetitive tasks are still valuable; they teach you discipline, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of the data side of software engineering. And hey, those skills often make you a better developer down the line.

You can also make the most of this opportunity by actively seeking out side projects—maybe build your own small app or contribute to open source on platforms like GitHub. This way you can gain exposure to more feature development, bug-fixing, and a broader tech stack. Even a few hours a week on side projects can make a big difference in your portfolio.

At work, it might help to talk to your manager about your career goals. Ask if there’s any chance you could get involved in different projects, or even shadow teams working on feature development. Also, if you have some spare time, consider brushing up on those other skills through online courses. We at Tech Leaders Launchpad have courses that dive into more diverse aspects of software engineering (and leadership skills too!), which might help fill in the gaps. Feel free to check us out at [https://techleaderslaunchpad.com ](https://techleaderslaunchpad.com/)for some tailored guidance.

Bottom line: While your current role might not be ideal, it’s a stepping stone. Be proactive, invest in side projects, and look for learning opportunities. Over time, you'll build a robust skill set that future employers will appreciate.
